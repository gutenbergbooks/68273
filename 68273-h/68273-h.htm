  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER I<br /> <span class='large'>A WEDDING FROLIC AT FOREST REST</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The good folk of our county always seized with gladness
any fair excuse for merry-making, especially in the
dead of winter, when farm work was slack.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now the marriage of the popular young doctor with
the well-liked young teacher was one of the best of excuses
for general outbreak into gayety.</p>

<p class='c008'>True, the newly married pair wished to settle down
at once in their pretty cottage home, and be quiet.</p>

<p class='c008'>But they were not to be permitted to do so.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every family to whom the young doctor stood in the
relation of attendant physician gave either a dinner or a
dancing party.</p>

<p class='c008'>Judge Paul McCann, an old bachelor, who was one of
his most valuable patients—a chronic patient dying of
good living, and taking a long, long time to do it in—gave
a heavy dinner party, to which he invited only married
or middle-aged people—such as the elder Forces,
Grandieres, Elks, and—Miss Bayard, who did not attend.</p>

<p class='c008'>This dinner came off on the Monday after the marriage,
and was a great success.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every one was pleased, except the young people who
had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>“Selfish old rhinoceros! Wouldn’t give a dancing
party because he’s got the gout! And Natty so fond of
dancing, too!” growled Wynnette, over her disappointment
on that occasion.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the Grandieres consoled her and all the young
people by giving a dancing party at Oldfields on the following
Wednesday, and inviting all the members, young
and old, of every family in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c008'>This party was but a repetition, with improvements,
on the New Year’s Eve party, just four weeks previous;
for again there was a full moon, a deep, level snow,
frozen over, and fine sleighing, and all circumstances
combined to make the entertainment a most enjoyable
one.</p>

<p class='c008'>This frolic was followed on Friday with a dancing
party given by the Elks at Grove Hill, to which the same
people were invited, and where they talked, laughed and
danced as merrily as before.</p>

<p class='c008'>And do you think that the descendant of the “Dook of
England” was one to neglect her social duties, or to be
left behind in the competition of hospitable attentions to
the bride and groom because her house was small and
her means were even smaller?</p>

<p class='c008'>Not at all! So she determined to give a dancing
party on the next Tuesday evening, and invite all the
neighborhood with his wife and children, and “his sisters,
aunts and cousins.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, great Jehosophat, Aunt Sibby, if you ask all
these people, what are you going to do with them? They
can’t all get into the house, you know!” exclaimed Roland
Bayard, while his aunt and himself were forming
a committee of ways and means.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s <em>their</em> business! <em>My</em> business is to invite them
to a party, and to open the door. <em>Their</em> business is to
get in the house—if they can. Do your duty, sez I!
Without fear or favor, sez I! Do the proper thing, sez
I! unregardless of consequences, sez I! <em>My</em> duty is to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>give a party to the bride and groom, and I’m a-going to
do it! Take your own share of the world’s play, sez I,
as well as the world’s work, sez I! We can’t live our
lives over again, sez I!</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Live while you live, the sacred preachers say,</div>
      <div class='line'>And seize the pleasures of the passing day.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“I think you have got that quotation wrong, auntie,”
said Roland.</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Tain’t quotation, you ignomanners! It’s verses out
of the ‘English Reader’ as I used to study when I went
to school to young Luke Barriere, when he was young
Luke, and before he left off teaching and divested all his
yearnings into a grocery.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, you have got the lines wrong, anyway, Aunt
Sibby.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I tell you I ain’t! What do you know about it?
I’ve read more verse books than ever you knew the names
of! But that ain’t nothing to the point! What I want
you to do is to take the mule cart and drive round the
neighborhood, and invite all the company—everybody
that we saw at all the other parties! Every one of ’em—childun
and all! When you do a thing, sez I, do it
well, sez I! What’s worth a-doing of at all, sez I, is
worth doing well, sez I!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I might as well start at once, as it will take me all
day to go the rounds. I’ll go harness up the mule now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, go; and wherever you happen to be at dinner
time there you stop and get your dinner. I shan’t expect
you home till night, because after you have given
out all the invitations, you know, I want you to call at
old Luke Barriere’s grocery store and fetch me——Stop!
have you got a pencil in your pocket?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Aunt Sibby.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, then, put down—Lord! where shall I get a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>piece of writing paper? Hindrances, the first thing!
It’s always the way, sez I!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It need not be writing paper. This will do,” said
Roland, tearing off a scrap of brown wrapper from a
parcel that lay on the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, then, write,” said Miss Sibby.</p>

<p class='c008'>And she gave him a list for sugar, spices, candies,
“reesins” and “ammuns,” “orringes” and “lemmuns.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is this all?” inquired Roland.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and tell Luke Barriere he must charge it to me,
and tell him I’ll pay him as soon as I get paid for that
last hogshead of tobacco I shipped to Barker’s.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, auntie.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And, mind, as I told you before, I shan’t expect you
home to dinner. You won’t have time to come. And I
shan’t get no dinner, neither, ’cause all the fireplace will
be took up baking cakes. Soon’s ever you’re gone, me
and Mocka is a-going right at making of ’em. Thanks
be to goodness as we have got a-plenty of our own flour,
and eggs, and milk, and butter! And when you have
got plenty of flour, and eggs, and milk, and butter, sez
I, you’ll get along, sez I!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well, Aunt Sibby.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And don’t you forget to invite Luke Barriere to the
party, mind you! You mustn’t forget old friends, sez
I!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! And must I invite Judge Paul McCann?” inquired
the sailor, with a twinkle in his eye, for you see</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“They had been friends in youth.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“No!” emphatically replied the old lady. “No!
Them as has the least to do with old Polly McCann, sez
I, comes the best off, sez I! There! Now go! You
ain’t got a minute more to lose!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The young man went out to the little stable behind
the house, and put the mule to the cart, and drove
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>around to the front door, to come in and get his overcoat
and cap.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! I forgot to tell you, Roland! Hire the nigger
fiddlers while you are out,” said Miss Sibby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll remember, aunt,” replied the young man, drawing
on his “surtout,” and, with cap and gloves in hand,
hurrying out to the cart.</p>

<p class='c008'>In another moment Miss Sibby heard the mule cart
rattle away on its rounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>She then tied on a large apron, rolled up her sleeves,
washed her hands, and went into the kitchen to make
cakes.</p>

<p class='c008'>And all that day her two servants, Mocka and Gad,
had a time of it!</p>

<p class='c008'>Late in the evening Roland came back with a cargo
of groceries, and the report that all the neighborhood
had been invited to her party, and had accepted the
invitation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now, Aunt Sibby, it is getting awfully serious!
If they all come—and they will all come—where are
you going to put them? Here are only three rooms on
this floor—the kitchen, the parlor and the parlor bedroom,”
said Roland, in real concern.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Le’s see,” mused the old lady, looking around.
“‘Where there’s a will there’s a way,’ sez I! And, Lord
knows, as I have got the will, I must find the way! The
party is given to the young bride and groom, and for the
sake of the dancers, and they must have the preference.
Le’s see, now: The bed must be took out’n the parlor
bedroom and put upstairs. The folks as don’t dance
must sit in the parlor bedroom, with the door open, so
as they may see the dancing and hear the music. Then
the dancers must dance in this parlor, and the nigger
fiddlers can play in the kitchen, with the door open, so
the music can be heard all over the house. The two
rooms upstairs can be used for the ladies’ and gentlemen’s
dressing rooms. Oh, there’s ample space! ample!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>And we shall have a grand time, Roland!” said the old
lady of sixty-one with the heart of sixteen.</p>

<p class='c008'>And her words came true. Everything was propitious.
To be sure, the moonlight was gone; but the
sky was clear and cold, and the stars sparkling with the
brilliancy that is only to be seen in just such winter
weather, and the snow was deep and frozen hard, and
the sleighing was “hevvingly,” as the lady from Wild
Cats’ described it.</p>

<p class='c008'>And when all the company were assembled in Miss
Sibby’s little, hospitable house, and divided into rooms
according to her plan, there was really no uncomfortable
crowd at all.</p>

<p class='c008'>Roland Bayard received all the guests at the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gad showed the gentlemen upstairs into the little
north bedroom, and Mocka conducted the ladies up into
the little south bedroom.</p>

<p class='c008'>Both these small attic chambers had been neatly prepared
as dressing rooms.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the guests came down, Miss Sibby, in her only
black silk dress and Irish gauze cap, received them at
the foot of the stairs, and took them in turn to their
appointed places.</p>

<p class='c008'>The negro fiddlers were seated in the kitchen near
the door, which was opened into the parlor.</p>

<p class='c008'>The young people formed a double set on the parlor
floor.</p>

<p class='c008'>The elders sat on comfortable seats in the parlor bedroom,
with the door open, so that they could see the
dancers and hear the music, while gossiping with each
other.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“The fun grew fast and furious”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>as the witches’ dance at Kirk Alloway.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Sibby!” cried Wynnette, in one of the breathless
pauses of the whirling reel—“Miss Sibby, for downright
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>roaring fun and jollification your party does whip
the shirt off the back of every party given this winter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m proud you like it; but, oh, my dear Miss Wynnette
Force, do not put it that there way! Wherever
did you pick up sich expressions? It must a been from
them niggers,” said Miss Sibby, deprecatingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I reckon it was from the niggers I ‘picked up sich
expressions,’ Miss Sibby, for the words and phrases they
let fall are often very expressive—and I take to them
so naturally that I sometimes think I must have been a
nigger myself in some stage of pre-existence,” laughed
Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know what you are talking about, child; but
I do know as you sartainly ought to break yourself of
that there habit of speaking.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do try to, Miss Sibby! I correct myself almost
every time,” said Wynnette, and then craning her neck
with dignity, she added—“What I meant to say about
your entertainment, Miss Bayard, was that it is far the
most enjoyable I have attended this season.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank y’, honey, that’s better! A young lady can’t
be too particular, sez I!” concluded Miss Sibby. But
before she finished speaking the whirl of the reel had
carried Wynnette off to the other end of the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dancing continued until ten o’clock.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fiddlers rested from their labors and took their
grog.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dancers sat down to recover their breath and to
partake of refreshments in the form of every sort of
cake, candy, nut and raisin, to say nothing of apple
toddy, lemon punch and eggnogg.</p>

<p class='c008'>When all had been refreshed the music and dancing
recommenced and continued until midnight, when they
wound up the ball with the giddy Virginia reel.</p>

<p class='c008'>The hot mulled port wine was handed round and
drunk amid much laughing, talking and jesting.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the company put on their wraps, took leave of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>their happy hostess, re-entered their sleighs and started
merrily for their homes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lady from the gold diggings had partaken so
heartily of all the good things provided by Miss Sibby,
and had tested so conscientiously the rival merits of
apple toddy, lemon punch, eggnogg and mulled port,
that she went sound asleep in the sleigh and slept all the
way to Mondreer and on being roused up to enter the
house she addressed the dignified squire as Joe Mullins,
and remarked that she thought the lead was running out
at Wild Cats’, and they had better vamose the gulch
and go prospecting some’eres else.</p>

<p class='c008'>However, she slept off the effects of the party and
was her own happy and hearty self at breakfast the next
morning.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER II<br /> <span class='large'>ODALITE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Among all the merry-makers there was one sad face—Odalite’s—which
no effort of self-control could make
otherwise than sad.</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite, for the sake of her young sisters, had joined
every party, but she took no pleasure in them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now that all the distracting excitement was over, and
she could think calmly of the circumstances, they all
combined to distress, mortify and humiliate her. The
remembrance of that scene in the church, of which at
the time it transpired she was but half conscious, was to
her so shameful and degrading that she secretly shrank
from the eyes of friends and neighbors whom she was
obliged to meet at the various gatherings in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the doubt of her real relations to the Satan who
had entered her Eden, the uncertainty of her true position,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>and the instability of her circumstances, all gathered
around her like heavy clouds and darkened, saddened
and oppressed her spirits.</p>

<p class='c008'>That Anglesea had no moral claim on her she was perfectly
well assured. That her father would protect her
against him she felt equally certain. But that the man
might have a legal claim upon her—supposing his marriage
with the Widow Wright to have been an irregular
one—and that he might give her dear mother and herself
trouble through that claim, she was sorely afraid.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then there was Le—her dear, noble, generous Le—who
had pardoned her apparent defection and had
sworn to be faithful to her and share her fate to the end
of life, even though that fate should oblige them to live
apart in celibacy forever. Her heart ached for Le. She
had had but one letter from him since he left the house,
a month before. In it he told her that he had reached
his ship only six hours before she was to sail, and that
he had only time to write a few farewell lines on the
eve of departure. But these lines were, indeed, full of
love, faith and hope. He told her that he should keep a
diary for her, and send it in sections by every opportunity.
And he renewed all his vows of fidelity to her
through life.</p>

<p class='c008'>That was his first and last letter up to this time.
But now she was looking for another.</p>

<p class='c008'>This daily expectation and the weekly visits to Greenbushes
helped to occupy her mind, and enabled her to
endure life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Old Molly, the housekeeper there, who did not understand,
and could not appreciate, the comfort and consolation
that Odalite derived from these weekly inspections,
remonstrated on the subject, saying:</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Deed, Miss Odalite, ’tain’t no use for you to take all
dis yere trouble for to come ober yere ebery week to see
as de rooms is all opened and aired and dried—’deed it
ain’t. You can trust me—’deed you can. Now did you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>eber come ober yere on a Wednesday morning, and not
find a fire kindled into ebery room in de house, and de
windows all opened, ef it was clear? And likewise, if
you war to come at night, you’d find the fires all out, and
the windows all shut, and the rooms all dry as a toast.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know I can trust you thoroughly, Molly, but you
see I like to come. It seems to bring me nearer Le, you
know,” Odalite replied, in her gentle and confiding way.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, honey, so it do, indeed. Well, it was a awful
set-down to us w’en dat forriner come yere an’ cut Marse
Le out, an’ him a married man, too, Lord save us!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush, Molly. You must not speak of that person to
me,” said Odalite, sternly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lord, honey, I ain’t a-blamin’ of you. Well I knows
as you couldn’t help it. Well I knows as he give you
witch powders, or summut, to make you like him whedder
or no. W’ite people don’t believe nuffin ’bout dese
witch powders, but we dem colored people we knows,
honey. But now he is foun’ out an’ druv away, we dem
all sees as you is a fo’gettin’ de nonsense, honey, ’cause
he can’t give you no mo’ witch powders. Lor’! why, if
it had been true love you feeled for him, you couldn’t
a got ober it as soon as you has, eben if yer had foun’
him out to be de gran’ vilyun as he is, ’cause it would
a took time. But as it war not true love, but only witch
powders, you see you got ober it eber since he went away.
Lor’! I knows about witch powders.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Please, Mollie,” pleaded Odalite.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the negro woman, having mounted her hobby,
rocked on:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Neber mind, honey. You and Marse Le is young
’nough to spare t’ree years, an’ next time he come home,
please de Lord, we’ll all ’joy a merry marridge, an’ you
an’ him to come to housekeeping ’long of us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite took leave, and went home. That was the
only way in which she could escape the painful subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>She found a letter from Le on her return. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>dated last from Rio de Janeiro. It contained the daily
record of the young midshipman’s life on the man-of-war,
and no end to the vows of love and constancy.</p>

<p class='c008'>This letter came under cover to her mother. It
cheered Odalite up for days.</p>

<p class='c008'>But again her spirits sank.</p>

<p class='c008'>At length her health began to suffer, and then her
parents took into consideration a plan that had been
discussed a month before. This was to leave the plantation
under the competent direction of their long-known
overseer and their family solicitor, and to take a furnished
house in Washington City for three years, during
which time they could place their two younger
daughters at a good finishing school, and introduce their
eldest into society.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Mrs. Force who had first proposed the plan,
and it was she who now recurred to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know, dear Abel,” she said to her husband,
while they were sitting together one morning in her little
parlor, “you know that two considerations press on us
now—the health of Odalite and the education of Wynnette
and Elva. I really fear for Odalite, and so does
Dr. Ingle, if she should be permitted to remain in this
neighborhood, where everything reminds her of the distress
and mortification she has suffered. Odalite must
have a thorough change. And no better change can be
thought of for her than a winter in Washington. The
gay season is just commencing in that city, and with all
that we could do for her there Odalite would be sure
to improve. Think what a contrast Washington in its
season—Washington with its splendid official receptions,
its operas and concerts, every day and night—would be
to the secluded life we all lead here. And especially
what a contrast in the conception of Odalite, who will
see the city for the first time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I appreciate all that; but, my love, your simple wish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>to go to the city would be quite sufficient for me,” said
the squire.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Force turned away her head and breathed a sigh,
as she often did at any especial mark of love or trust
from her good husband.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should not express the wish on my own account,
dear Abel. I have always been well content with our
retired life and your society alone. I spoke only for the
children’s sake. I have told you why Odalite needs the
change, and now I wish to tell you how our residence
in Washington will benefit her younger sisters. Wynnette
and Elva must go on with their education. We
would not like to engage a stranger to come and take
charge of them here, just after such a public event as
that of the broken marriage, even if we could get one to
replace Natalie Meeke, or suit us as well as she did,
which I am sure we could not. Nor, on the other hand,
could we consent to send our children away from us.
So I see no better plan for them, as well as for all, than
that we should all go to Washington, where we can give
our Odalite the social life that she so much needs just
now, and where we can enter Wynnette and Elva as day
pupils in a first-class school.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear, I see that you are right,” said Mr. Force.
“You are quite right in regard to the wisdom of going
to Washington, so far as the benefit of our children is
concerned; nor do I see any hindrance to our leaving
this place without our care. Barnes is an invaluable
farm manager, and Copp is as capable an agent as any
proprietor could desire. We will leave the place in their
care. We can go at once, or just as soon as you can
pack up. If we cannot secure a furnished house at once
we can go to a hotel and stay until we can get one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But—what shall we do with Mrs. Anglesea?” demanded
Mrs. Force, in sudden dismay as the vision of
the lady from Wild Cats’ arose in her mind’s eye.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Abel Force gave a long, low whistle, and then answered:</p>

<p class='c008'>“We must invite her to go with us to Washington.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“To——Invite Mrs. Anglesea to join our party to
Washington?” gasped the lady.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. She will be charmed to accept, I am sure,”
replied the gentleman, with a twinkle of humor in his
eye.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, good heavens, Abel! how could we introduce
that woman into Washington society?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well, indeed. Very much better than we could
into any other society on the face of the earth. The
wives of the high officers of the government are the leaders
of society; the latter are under the dominion of the
sovereign people, who flock to the city in great numbers,
and from all parts of the country, and all ranks and
grades of the social scale; and you will find the drawing
rooms of cabinet ministers and foreign ambassadors
filled with companies more mixed than you could find
elsewhere in the world. Our lady from the gold mines
will find plenty to keep her in countenance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“For all that,” said Mrs. Force, “I shall try to evade
the necessity of taking her with us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear, we cannot, in decency, turn our guest out
of doors; so the only alternative we have is to take her
with us or stay at home.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think—she is so simple, good-humored and unconventional—that
I think I may explain to her the necessity
of our going to Washington for the sake of the
children, and then give her a choice to go with us or to
remain here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s it!” exclaimed Mr. Force. “And let us hope
that she will elect to remain.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A little later in the day Mrs. Force had an explanation
with her guest, and put the alternative before her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will understand, dear Mrs. Anglesea, the cruel
necessity that obliges us to leave our home at this juncture;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>and now I wish you to be guided by your own impulses
whether to go with us to Washington or to remain
here as long as it may suit you to do so,” said the lady,
in conclusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You say you’re all a-gwine to a hotel?” inquired the
visitor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, then, you don’t catch me leavin’ of a comfortable
home like this, where there’s plenty of turkeys, and
canvas-back ducks, and game of all sorts, as the niggers
shoot and sell for a song, and feather beds, and good
roaring fires, and cupboards full of preserves and sweetmeats,
to go to any of your hotels to get pizened by their
messes, or catch my death in damp sheets. No, ma’am,
no hotels for me, if you please. I got enough of ’em at
the Hidalgo. I know beans, I do; and I stays here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well. I shall be glad to think of you here; and
I shall leave Lucy and Jacob in the house to take care
of it, and they will wait on you,” said the well-pleased
lady of the manor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll make myself comfortable, you bet, ole ’oman!
and I’ll take good care of the house while you’re gone—you
may stake your pile on that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And so this matter was satisfactorily settled.</p>

<p class='c008'>Preparations for departure immediately began, and
soon the news got abroad in the neighborhood that the
Forces were going to leave Mondreer and live in Washington.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER III<br /> <span class='large'>ROSEMARY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Rosemary, my dear, I wish you would not dance all
the time with young Roland Bayard when you happen
to be at a party with him,” said the grave and dignified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Miss Susannah Grandiere to the fair little niece who sat
at her feet, both literally and figuratively.</p>

<p class='c008'>The early tea was over at Grove Hill, and the aunt
and niece sat before the fire, with their maid Henny in
attendance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Grandiere was knitting a fine white lamb’s wool
stocking; Rosemary was sewing together pieces for a
patchwork quilt; and Henny, seated on a three-legged
stool in the chimney corner, was carding wool.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not, Aunt Sukey?” inquired the child, pushing
the fine, silky black curls from her dainty forehead and
looking up from her work.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because, my dear, though you are but a little girl,
and he is almost a young man, yet these intimate friendships,
formed in early youth, may become very embarrassing
in later years,” gravely answered the lady, drawing
out her knitting needle from the last taken off stitch
and beginning another round.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But how, Aunt Sukey?” questioned the little one.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In this way. No one knows who Roland Bayard is!
He was cast up from the wreck of the <em>Carrier Pigeon</em>,
the only life saved. He was adopted and reared by Miss
Sibby Bayard, and I think, but am not sure, he was
educated at the expense of Abel Force, who never lets
his left hand know what his right hand does in the way
of charity. But Miss Sibby has hinted as much to me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aunt Sukey, he may be the son of a lord, or a duke,
or a prince,” suggested romantic Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Or of a thief, or pirate, or convict,” added Miss
Grandiere, severely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Aunt Sukey! Never! Never! Dear Roland!
Aunt Sukey, I like Roland so much! And I have good
reason to like him, too, whatever he may be!” exclaimed
the child, with more than usual earnestness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! oh! oh!” moaned Miss Grandiere, sadly, shaking
her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aunt Sukey, no one ever has the kindness to ask a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>little girl like me to dance except dear Roland. Other
gentlemen ask young ladies; but dear Roland always
asks me, and he never lets me be neglected. And I shall
never forget him for it, but shall always like him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Um, um, um!” softly moaned the stately lady to herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And Roland told me he was named after a knight
who was ‘without fear and without reproach,’ and that
he meant always to deserve his name, and to be my
knight—mine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dear, dear, dear!” murmured Miss Grandiere.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is the matter, Aunt Sukey?” inquired Rosemary,
again pushing back her silky, black curls, and
lifting her large, light blue eyes to the lady’s troubled
face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Rosemary, my child,” began Miss Grandiere, with
out replying to the little girl’s question, “Rosemary, you
know the Forces are going to Washington next week?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! yes; everybody knows that now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And Wynnette and Elva are going to be put to school
there?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, everybody knows that, too, Aunt Sukey.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, how would you like to be put to the same
school that they are going to attend?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, so much! So very much, Aunt Sukey! I never
dreamed of such happiness as that! I do so much want
to get a good education!” exclaimed the little girl, firing
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, my dear child, I think the opportunity of sending
you to school with Wynnette and Elva, and under
the protection of Mr. and Mrs. Force, is such an excellent
one that it ought not to be lost. I will speak to my
sister Hedge about it, and if she will consent to your
going I will be at the cost of sending you,” said the lady,
as she began to roll up her knitting, for the last gleam
of the winter twilight had faded out of the sky and it
was getting too dark even to knit.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>For once in her life Rosemary had forgotten to call
for the curtains to be let down and the candle to be lit
and the novel brought forth. For once the interests of
real life had banished the memory of romance.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Henny knew what was expected of her, and so
she put up her cards, went and lighted the tallow candle,
pulled down the window blinds, replenished the fire, and
reseated herself on her three-legged stool in the chimney
corner.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rosemary, recalled to the interests of the evening,
went and brought forth the “treasured volume” from
the upper bureau drawer and gave it to her aunt to read.
Then she settled herself in her low chair to listen.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was still that long romance of “The Children of
the Abbey” that was the subject of their evening readings.
And they had now reached a most thrilling crisis,
where the heroine was in the haunted castle; when suddenly
the sound of wheels was heard to grate on the
gravel outside, accompanied by girlish voices.</p>

<p class='c008'>And soon there came a knock at the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who in the world can that be at this hour, after
dark?” inquired Miss Grandiere, as Henny arose and
opened the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite, Wynnette and Elva came in, in their poke
bonnets and buttoned coats.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Miss Grandiere, excuse us, but yours was the
only light we saw gleaming around the edges of the
blinds, and so we knocked at your door,” said Wynnette,
who always took the initiative in speaking, as in other
things.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear child! how is it that you children are out,
after dark?” inquired the lady.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We have been making the rounds to bid good-by to
the neighbors. Mamma and papa went out yesterday,
and we to-day. We are going to Washington next week,
and we have come to bid you good-by now,” said Wynnette,
still speaking for all the others.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“But who is with you for protection? Who drove the
carriage?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jake drove and Joshua came as bodyguard; but we
are so late that I am afraid Mr. and Mrs. Elk and the
girls are asleep.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They are, my dears; and it is so late that I do not
think it right for you three children to be driving
through the country with no better protection than Jake
and the dog. You must send them home and stay all
night here. Then you will have an opportunity of bidding
good-by to William and Molly and the children
to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Miss Grandiere, how jolly! I have not spent a
night from home for ages and ages and ages!” exclaimed
Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what will mamma say?” doubtfully inquired
Elva.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I fear, Miss Grandiere, that we ought to return home
to-night,” suggested Odalite.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nonsense, my dear child! You must do nothing of
the sort. I will write a note to your mother and send it
by Jake,” replied Miss Grandiere, who immediately arose
and went to get her portfolio.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If it hadn’t been for Miss Sibby Bayard keeping us
so long talking about her ancestor the ‘Duke of England’—she
means the Duke of Norfolk all the time, but flouts
us when we hint as much—we should have been here
two hours ago, and been home by this time,” said Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Grandiere finished her note, put a shawl over her
head and went out herself to speak to the coachman and
send him home to Mondreer with her written message.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now take off your hats and coats, and tell me if you
have had tea,” she said, when she came back into the
room and closed the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes! we took tea with Miss Sibby while she told
us how a certain ‘Duke of England’ lost his head for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>wanting to marry a certain Queen of Scotland,” replied
Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>That question settled, the girls drew chairs around
the fire, and began to make themselves comfortable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rosemary could not bear to give up her reading, just
at that particular crisis, too! So she thought she would
entice her company into listening to the story.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We were reading—oh! such a beautiful book!” she
said. “Just hear how lovely it begins!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And she took the book up, turned it to the first page
and commenced after this manner:</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Hail! sweet asylum of my infancy! Content and
innocence abide beneath your humble roof!—hail! ye
venerable trees! My happiest hours of childish gayety——’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s all that about?” demanded Wynnette, the
vandal, ruthlessly interrupting the reader.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is Amanda Fitzallan, coming back to the Welsh
cottage where she was nursed, and catching sight of it,
you know, raises fluttering emotions in her sensitive
bosom,” Rosemary explained, with an injured air.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! it does, does it? But she wouldn’t hold forth
in that way, you know, even if she were badly stage
struck or very crazy,” said Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! I thought it was such elegant language!”
pleaded Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But she wouldn’t use it! Look here! Do you suppose,
when I come back from school, years hence, and
catch sight of Mondreer, I should hold forth in that
hifaluting style?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what would you say?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing, probably; or if I did, it would be: ‘There’s
the blessed old barn now, looking as dull and humdrum
as it did when we used to go blackberrying and get our
ankles full of chego bites. Lord! how many dull days
we have passed in that dreary old jail, especially in rainy
weather!’ I think that would be about my talk.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“Oh, Wynnette! you have no sentiment, no reverence,
no——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nonsense!” good-humoredly replied the girl, finishing
Rosemary’s halting sentence.</p>

<p class='c008'>The little girl sighed, closed the book and laid it on
the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The style of that work is very elegant and refined;
and it is better to err on the side of elegance and refinement
than on their opposites,” said Miss Grandiere, with
her grandest air.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As I do every time I open my mouth. But I can’t
help it, Miss Susannah. ‘I am as Heaven made me,’ as
somebody or other said—or ought to have said, if they
didn’t,” retorted Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>As it was now bedtime it became necessary to attend
to the sleeping accommodations of these unexpected
guests. But first it was in order to offer them some
refreshments. Henny was not required to draw a jug
of hard cider, or to make and bake hoe cakes in the
bedroom that night. Such “orgies” were only enacted
by the aunt and niece in the seclusion of their private
life.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the corner cupboard was unlocked, and a store
of rich cake and pound cake, with a cut-glass decanter
of cherry bounce, all of which was kept for company,
was brought forth and served to the visitors.</p>

<p class='c008'>Meanwhile, Henny went upstairs to kindle a fire in
the large, double-bedded spare room, just over Miss
Sukey’s chamber.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Susannah,” said Odalite, while the group sat
around the fire nibbling their cake and sipping their
bounce, “I have a favor to ask of you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anything in the world that I can do for you, Odalite,
shall be done with the greatest pleasure,” earnestly
replied the elder lady.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thank you very much, dear friend; and now I will
explain: I promised Le, before we went away, that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>would go to Greenbushes once a week to see that the
rooms were regularly opened, aired and dried. I have
kept the promise up to the present; but now, you know,
I have to go with the family to Washington. I have
no alternative, and for that reason I would like you to
be my proxy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will, with great pleasure, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I could not ask you to go every week, that would
be too much; but if you can go occasionally and see that
all is right, and drop me a note to that effect, it will—well,
it will relieve my conscience,” concluded Odalite,
with a wan smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I certainly will go every week, unless prevented by
circumstances; and I will write to you as often as I go,
to let you know how all is getting on there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you are very kind, Miss Susannah; but I fear
you will find it a tax upon your time and patience.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not at all. I shall have plenty of time, and little
that is interesting to fill it up with. For let me tell you
a secret. I intend to avail myself of the opportunity of
your parents being in Washington to send my little Rosemary
to the same school that Wynnette and Elva will
attend.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, that will be jolly!” “Oh, that will be lovely!”
exclaimed Wynnette and Elva, in the same instant.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is, if Mr. and Mrs. Force will not consider the
addition of Rosemary to their party an intrusion.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, Miss Susannah! How dare you slander my
father and mother right before my two looking eyes?”
exclaimed Wynnette. “They will be just set up to have
Rosemary! Besides, where’s the intrusion, I’d like to
know? The railroad and the hotel and the boarding
school are just as free for you as for me, I should
think.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Rosemary would board at the school, of course,” continued
Miss Grandiere.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So shall Elva and I. If papa could have got a furnished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>house we should have lived at home, and entered
the academy as day pupils; but, you see, as papa could
not get a house he and mamma and Odalite will live at
one of the West End hotels, and Elva and I at the
academy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And, oh! won’t it be lovely to have dear Rosemary
with us? We should not feel half so strange,” said little
Elva.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will speak to your father and mother on the
subject when you go home, Odalite, my child; and I
will call on them later. If they will take charge of
Rosemary on the journey, and enter her at the same
school with yourselves, I will be at all the charges, of
course, and I shall feel very much obliged,” said Miss
Susannah.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You may rest assured that papa and mamma will be
very glad to take charge of dear little Rosemary; not
only for her sake and for your sake, but for our sakes,
so that we may have an old playmate from our own
neighborhood to be our schoolmate in the new home,”
said Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There is something in that,” remarked Miss Grandiere.</p>

<p class='c008'>As for Elva and Rosemary, they were sitting close
together on one chair, with their arms locked around
each other’s waist, in fond anticipation of their coming
intimacy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Henny now came in and said that the spare room was
all ready for the young ladies.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Grandiere lighted a fresh candle, and conducted
her visitors to the upper chamber, saw that all their
wants were supplied, and bade them good-night.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon after, aunt and niece also retired to bed; but
Rosemary could not sleep for the happiness of thinking
about going to boarding school in the city along with
Wynnette and Elva.</p>

<p class='c008'>Early in the morning William and Molly Elk, their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>little girls, and in fact the whole household, with the
exception of Miss Sukey, her niece and her maid, were
astonished to hear that there were visitors in the house
who had arrived late on the night before.</p>

<p class='c008'>They prepared a better breakfast than usual in their
honor, and gave them a warm welcome.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon after breakfast, Jake arrived with the family
carriage to fetch the young people home, and also with a
message from Mr. and Mrs. Force, thanking Miss Grandiere
for having detained their imprudent children all
night.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You and Rosemary go home with us, Miss Susannah.
There’s plenty of room inside the carriage for six people,
and we would only be five. Do, now! And let us have
this matter of going to school settled at once,” urged
Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Grandiere hesitated, even though Elva joined in
the invitation. But when Odalite, the eldest and grown-up
sister, added her entreaties to those of the others,
Miss Sukey yielded, because she wanted to yield.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls then took leave of all their friends at Grove
Hill and entered the capacious carriage, accompanied by
Miss Grandiere and Rosemary—that is, two of them
did. One was missing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where is Wynnette?” inquired Miss Grandiere, as
she sank into the cushions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She is on the box, driving, while Jacob is sitting with
folded arms beside her,” answered Odalite.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is highly improper.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You cannot do anything with Wynnette, Miss Susannah.
She will drive as often as she can. And
Jacob’s presence beside her makes it safe, at least. He
is ready to seize the reins at any emergency.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, but really—really—my dear Odalite——”</p>

<p class='c008'>The sudden starting of the horses at a spanking pace
jerked Miss Grandiere’s words from her lips, and herself
forward into little Elva’s arms.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>However, they arrived safely at Mondreer, where
they were very cordially welcomed by Mr. and Mrs.
Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Miss Grandiere proposed her plan of sending
Rosemary with them, to go to school with their own
children, the lady and gentleman responded promptly
and cordially.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We have not selected our school yet,” Mr. Force explained.
“We wish to get the circulars and personally
inspect the schools before we make our choice, but if
you leave your niece in our hands, we shall do by her
exactly as by our own.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am sure you will. And I thank you from my soul
for the trouble you take. I shall sign some blank checks,
for you to fill out, for any funds that may be required
for Rosemary,” gratefully responded Miss Grandiere.</p>

<p class='c008'>The aunt and niece, at the cordial invitation of the
Forces, stayed to dinner, and were afterward sent home
in a wide buggy driven by Jacob.</p>

<p class='c008'>One day later Miss Grandiere broached to Mrs. Hedge
the subject of sending Rosemary to school with Wynnette
and Elva Force, at her own—Miss Grandiere’s—expense.</p>

<p class='c008'>This consultation with the mother was a mere form,
Miss Susannah knowing full well that it was the great
ambition of Mistress Dolly’s heart to send her daughter
to a good boarding school, and that she would consider
the present opportunity most providential.</p>

<p class='c008'>All the arrangements were most satisfactorily concluded,
and by the end of the following week, the Forces,
with little Rosemary in their charge, had left Mondreer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'>AFTER A LAPSE OF TIME</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was three years after the Forces left Mondreer,
and they had never returned to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The farm was managed by Jesse Barnes, the capable
overseer, and the sales were arranged by Mr. Copp, the
family agent, who remitted the revenues of the estate
in quarterly installments to Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lady from the gold mines remained in the house,
taking such excellent care of the rooms and the furniture
that she had gradually settled down as a permanent
inmate, in the character of a salaried housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m a-getting too old to be bouncing round prospecting
with the boys, and so I reckon I had better sit down
in this comfortable sitiwation for the rest of my life,”
she confided to Miss Bayard, one February morning,
when that descendant of the great duke honored her by
coming to spend the day at Mondreer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s just what I sez myself. When you knows
you’re well enough off, sez I, you’d better let well enough
alone, sez I. And not take after them unsettled people
as are allus changing about from place to place, doing
no good,” assented Miss Bayard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a habit dey gibs deirselves. ’Deed it is, ole mist’ess.
Nuffin’ ’t all but a habit dey gibs deirselves,” remarked
Luce, who had just come in with a waiter, on
which was a plate of caraway-seed cake and a decanter
of blackberry cordial to refresh the visitor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just like my neffy, Roland. He was restless enough
after Le went to sea, but after the Forces left the neighborhood
and took Rosemary Hedge with ’em, ropes nor
chains wouldn’t hold that feller, but he must go off to
Baltimore to get a berth, as he called it. Thanks be to
goodness, he got in ’long of Capt. Grandiere as first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>mate; but Lord knows when I’ll ever see him ag’in, for
he is gone to the East Indies,” sighed Miss Sibby. And
then she stopped to nibble her seed cake and sip her
blackberry cordial.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a habit he gibs hisself, ole mist’ess. ’Deed it is.
Nuffin’ ’t all but a habit he gibs hisself, and you ought
to try to break him of it,” said Luce, as she set the
waiter down on the table and left the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you expect Abel Force ever to come home to
his own house again?” inquired Miss Sibby, between
her sips and nibbles.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, I reckon so, when the gals have finished
their edication, but not till then. You see they have a
lovely house in Washington, according to what Miss
Grandiere and little Rosemary Hedge tells us, and the
children are at a fine school, so they live there all the
year until the three months summer vacation comes
round, and then when Miss Grandiere goes to Washington
to fetch her little niece home to spend the holidays
here, why, then Mr. and Mrs. Force takes their three
daughters and go traveling. And this next summer they
do talk about going to Europe, but I don’t know that
they will do it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What I sez is that they ought to spend their summers
at Mondreer. When a family is blessed with the
blessing of a good, healthy country home, sez I, they
ought to stay in it, and be thankful for it, sez I.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Even while the two cronies spoke the door opened, and
Jacob came in, with a letter in his hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There! That’s from the ole ’oman now. I know
her handwriting across the room. And now we shall
hear some news,” said Mrs. Anglesea, with her mouth
full of cake.</p>

<p class='c008'>And she took the letter from the negro’s hands, and
opened it without ceremony, and began to read it to
herself, without apology.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>“Is it anything confidential?” demanded Miss Sibby,
who was full of curiosity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No. I will read it all to you as soon as ever I have
spelled it out myself. I never was good at reading writing,
particularly fine hand, and, if I must say it, the ole
’oman do write the scrimble-scramblest fine hand as ever
I see,” said Mrs. Anglesea, peering at the letter, and
turning it this way and that, and almost upside down.</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently she began to read, making comments between
the words and phrases of the letter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, it’s ‘Washington City, P Street, N. W., and
February 8th.’ Why, it’s been four days coming. Here
you, Jake! When did you get this letter out’n the post
office?” She paused to call the negro messenger, who
stood, hat in hand, at the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“W’y, dis mornin’, in course, ole mist’ess,” replied the
man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t ‘ole mist’ess’ me, you scalawag! Are you sartain
you didn’t get it Saturday, and forget all about it,
and leave it in your pocket until to-day?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hi, ole—young—mist’ess, how I gwine to forget
w’en you always ax me? No, ’deed. I took it out’n de
pos’ office dis blessed mornin’, ole—young mist’ess.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How dare you call me young mist’ess, you——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What mus’ I call you, den?” inquired the puzzled
negro.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ma’am. Call me ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s better. Well, now the next time you go to the
village, Jake, you just tell that postmaster if he keeps
back another letter of mine four days, I’ll have him
turned out. Do ye hear?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, now you may go about your business, and I
will go on with my letter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>The man left the room, and the housekeeper resumed
her reading:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘<span class='sc'>My Dear Mrs. Anglesea</span>’: I wish she wouldn’t
pile that name upon me so! If she knowed how I hated
it she wouldn’t. ‘I write to ask you to have the house
prepared for our reception on the eighth of June. You
will know what is necessary to be done, and you may
draw on Mr. Copp for the needful funds. He has instructions
to honor your drafts.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘The girls expect to grad—grat—gral—gual——’</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lord ’a’ mercy! what is this word? Can you make
it out, Miss Sibby?” inquired the reader, holding the
letter under the nose of the visitor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Bayard, who had resumed her knitting after
moderately partaking of cake and cordial, dropped her
work, adjusted her spectacles and inspected the word.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s graduate, ma’am. That means finish their edication,
honorable. Young Le Force graduated offen
the Naval ’Cademy before he ever went to sea as a midshipman,
and my scamp, Roland Bayard, graduated
offen the Charlotte Hall ’Cademy before he ran away
and went to sea as a common sailor. I s’pose these girls
is a-going to graduate offen the ‘cademy where they are
getting their edication, and I hope they will do theirselves
credit. When your parents do the best they can
for you, sez I, you ought to try to do the best you can
for yourself, sez I, which is the best return you can
make them, sez I.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“To do the best you can for them, I should think
would be the first thing to think about, and, likewise,
best return to make them. But now I’ll go on with my
letter:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘The girls expect to graduate at the academic commencement,

<p class='c008'>“So they are actually coming home at last,” said Miss
Sibby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, actially coming home at last,” assented the
housekeeper. “But, look here. What does she mean by
that news as she has got to tell me which concerns she

or anything? I hope to gracious he has! And then she
wouldn’t mention it in a letter, but wait until she could
tell me all about it! It must be that, ole ’oman—my
rascal’s hung!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I reckon it is! When a man lives a bad life, sez I,
he must expect to die a bad death, sez I.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I shan’t go in mourning for him, that’s certain,
whether he’s hung or drowned. But we shall hear
all about it when the folks come home. Lord! why, the
place will be like another house, with all them young
gals in it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I might ’a’ knowed somethin’ was up t’other Sunday,
when I heard Miss Grandiere tell Parson Peters, at All
Faith Church, how she and Mrs. Hedge were both going
to Washington on the first of June. Of course, it is
to the commencement they’re going, to see Rosemary
graduate along with the others.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But to hear ’em call the end of a thing its commencement,
takes me,” said Mrs. Anglesea.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So it do me. And if people don’t know what they’re
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>a-talking about, sez I, they’d better hold their tongues,
sez I.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Young Mrs. Ingle will be mighty proud to have the
old folks and the gals back. Lord! how fond she was
of them two little gals. To think of her naming her
two babies after them—the first Wynnette and the second
Elva. Let’s see; the first one must be two years
old.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wynnie is twenty-three months old, and Ellie is nine
months; but they are both sich smart, lively, sensible
children that any one might think as they was older than
that. But I don’t hold with children being took so much
notice of, and stimmerlated in their intellects so much.
Fair an’ easy, sez I; slow and sure, sez I, goes a long
way, sez I.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So, talking about their neighbors, as usual, but not
uncharitably, the gossips passed the day. At sunset they
had tea together; and then Gad brought around the
mule cart—the only equipage owned by the descendant
of the great duke—who put on her bonnet and shawl,
bid good-by to her crony, got into her seat and drove
homeward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, the ole ’oman has give me long enough notice
to get ready for ’em; but she knows there’s a good deal
to be done, and country workmen is slow, let alone the
niggers, who is slowest of all,” ruminated Mrs. Anglesea,
who resolved to begin operations next day.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER V<br /> <span class='large'>THE FORTUNES OF ODALITE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>To explain the mysterious letter written by Elfrida
Force to her housekeeper, we must condense the family
history of the last three years, which had passed without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>any incident worth recording, and bring it up to the time
when events full of importance for good or evil followed
each other in rapid succession.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force, on removing his family to Washington, in
the month of February three years before, took apartments
in one of the best hotels for himself, his wife,
and their eldest daughter, while he placed his two
younger daughters and his little ward at a first-class
boarding school.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Forces had some friends and acquaintances in
the city, and to these they sent cards, which were
promptly honored by calls.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the sake of Odalite, Mrs. Force chose to enter the
gay society for which she herself had little heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>The trousseau prepared for the girl’s luckless, broken
marriage came well into use as an elegant outfit for the
fashionable season in the gay capital.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force escorted his wife and daughter to all the
receptions, concerts, balls and dinners to which they
were invited, and everywhere he felt pride and pleasure
in the general  admiration bestowed upon his beautiful
wife and their lovely daughter.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the instinct of caste was strong in the breast of
Elfrida Force. She and her daughter were recipients
of many elegant entertainments, and she wished to reciprocate,
but could not do so while living at a hotel.</p>

<p class='c008'>His wife’s wishes, joined to his own longing for the
freedom of domestic life, added zeal to Abel Force’s
quest of a house.</p>

<p class='c008'>But it was at the end of the session of Congress before
his desire was gratified. Then a United States
senator, whose term of office had expired, offered his
handsome and elegantly furnished house for rent.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. and Mrs. Force inspected the premises, and
leased them for three years.</p>

<p class='c008'>They did not wish to go in at once, as the season was
at an end, and the summer at hand.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>But as soon as the retiring statesman and his family
had vacated the house Mr. Force sent in a squad of
housecleaners to prepare the place for the new tenants.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the schools closed for the long summer vacation
he gave little Rosemary Hedge into the hands of
Miss Grandiere, who had come to Washington to fetch
her home, and with his wife and three daughters left
the city for an extensive summer tour.</p>

<p class='c008'>After three months of varied travel the family returned
to Washington in September, and took possession
of the beautiful town house, near the P Street circle,
in the northwest section of the city.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then they replaced their daughters and their little
ward at the same school—not as boarders, however, but
as day pupils, for Mr. and Mrs. Force wished to have
their girls as much as possible under their own care,
believing home education to be the most influential for
good—or for evil—of all possible training.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Congress met, and the season began, Mrs.
Force took the lead by giving a magnificent ball, to
which all the beauty, fashion, wealth and celebrity of the
national capital were invited, to which they nearly all
came.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ball was a splendid success.</p>

<p class='c008'>The beautiful Elfrida Force became an acknowledged
queen of society, and her lovely young daughter was the
belle of the season.</p>

<p class='c008'>Had no one in the city then heard of her disastrous
wedding broken up at the altar?</p>

<p class='c008'>Not a soul had heard of it. Not one of those friends
and acquaintances of Mrs. Force whom she had met in
Washington, for, be it remembered, she had written to
no one of her daughter’s approaching marriage, and had
bid to the wedding only the nearest neighbors and oldest
friends of her family.</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite was saved this unmerited humiliation, at least—though
many who admired the beautiful girl wondered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>that the lovely, dark eyes never sparkled, the
sweet lips never smiled.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this season she had several “eligible” offers of marriage—one
from a young officer in the army; another
from a middle-aged banker; another from an aged cabinet
minister; a fourth from a foreign secretary of
legation; a fifth from a distinguished lawyer; a sixth
from a brilliant congressman; a seventh from a fashionable
preacher; and so on and so on.</p>

<p class='c008'>All these were declined with courtesy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite took very little pleasure in the gay life of
Washington, and very little pride in her conquests.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her sole delight was in Le’s letters, which came to
her under cover to her mother; but were read and enjoyed
by the whole family.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le certainly was a faithful servant of the great republic,
and never neglected his duty; but yet his “most
chiefest occupation” must have been writing to Odalite,
for his letters came by every possible opportunity, and
they were not only letters, but huge parcels of manuscript,
containing the journal of his thoughts, feelings,
hopes and purposes from day to day. And all these
might have been summed in one word—“Odalite.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She also sent letters as bulky and as frequently; and
all that she wrote might have been condensed into a monosyllable—“Le.”</p>

<p class='c008'>These parcels were always directed in the hand of her
mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ah! mother and daughter ever felt that the eyes of an
implacable enemy were secretly watching them, so that
they must be on their guard against surprise and
treachery.</p>

<p class='c008'>They suffered this fear, although they never heard
one word from, or of, Angus Anglesea. He might be
dead, living, or imprisoned, for aught they knew of his
state, condition, or whereabouts.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the distractions of society, however, they forgot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>their secret fears, for indeed they had no time for
reflection. This was one of the gayest seasons ever
known in the gay capital; reception, ball and concert followed
ball, concert and reception in a dizzy round; and
the Forces were seen at all! If they had purposely intended
to make up for all the long years of seclusion at
Mondreer they certainly and completely succeeded.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the end of the season they took a rest; but they
did not leave Washington until June, when the schools
closed, and then they placed little Rosemary Hedge in
the hands of Miss Grandiere, who came to the city to
receive her, and they went to Canada for the summer.</p>

<p class='c008'>As this first year passed, so passed the second and
nearly the whole of the third.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was in September of the third year that the monotony
of winter society and summer travel was broken by
something of vital interest to all their lives.</p>

<p class='c008'>They had just returned to Washington; replaced their
youngest daughters and their ward at school, and settled
themselves, with their eldest daughter, in their town
house, which had been renovated during their absence.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a season of repose coming between the summer
travel and the winter’s dissipations. They were receiving
no calls, making no visits, but just resting.</p>

<p class='c008'>One morning the father, mother and daughter were
seated in the back piazza which faced the west, and
was therefore, on this warm morning in September, cool
and shady. The piazza looked down upon a little back
yard, such as city lots can afford. But every inch of
the ground had been utilized, for a walk covered with
an arbor of latticework and grapevines led down to a
back gate and to the stables in the rear. On the right
hand of this walk was a green plot, with a pear tree and
a plum tree growing in the midst, and a border of gorgeous
autumn flowers blooming all around. On the other
side of the walk was another plot with a peach tree and
an apple tree growing in the midst, and a border of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>roses all around. And the grapevine and the fruit trees
were all in full fruition now, and supplied the dessert
every day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr., Mrs. and Miss Force were all seated in the pleasant
Quaker rocking-chairs with which this back piazza
was furnished.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force had the morning paper in his hands and
he was reading aloud to the two ladies, who were both
engaged in crochet work, when the back door opened and
a manservant came out and handed an enveloped newspaper
to his master, saying:</p>

<p class='c008'>“The postmaster has just left it, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And nothing else?” inquired the gentleman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing else, sir—only that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Only a newspaper,” said Mr. Force, laying it down
carelessly, without examination, as he resumed the
<cite>Union</cite> and the article he had been engaged in reading.</p>

<p class='c008'>No one felt the slightest interest in the paper that lay
neglected on the little stand beside Mr. Force’s chair.
Many newspapers came by mail, and but few of them
were opened. Mr. Force went on with his reading, and
Mrs. and Miss Force with their embroidery. And the
neglected newspaper, with its tremendous news, lay
there unnoticed and forgotten with the prospect of being
thrown, unopened, into the dust barrel; which must certainly
have been its fate, had not Odalite chanced to
cast her eye upon it and to observe something unfamiliar
in its style and character. In idle curiosity she took it
up, looked at it, and gave a cry.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <span class='large'>NEWS FROM COL. ANGLESEA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“What is it, my dear?” inquired her father, as Odalite,
with trembling fingers, tore off the envelope and
opened the paper.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>“It—it is—it is postmarked Angleton,” she faltered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Angleton! Give it to me!” peremptorily exclaimed
Abel Force, reaching his hand and taking the sheet from
his daughter, who yielded it up and then covered her
eyes with her hands, while her father examined the
paper and her mother looked on with breathless interest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank Heaven!” exclaimed Abel Force, as his eyes
were riveted on a paragraph he had found there.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What—what is it?” demanded Elfrida Force, in extreme
anxiety, while Odalite uncovered her eyes, and
gazed with eager look and lips apart.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A scoundrel has gone to his account! The earth is
rid of an incubus! Listen! This is the Angleton <cite>Advertiser</cite>
of August 20th, and it contains a notice of the
death of Angus Anglesea.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anglesea—dead!” exclaimed mother and daughter,
in a breath, and in tones that expressed almost every
other emotion under the sun, except sorrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, dead and gone to—his desserts!” exclaimed Abel
Force, triumphantly; but catching himself up short, before
he ended in a word that must never be mentioned,
under any circumstances. “Here is a notice of his
death.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Read it,” said Mrs. Force, while Odalite looked the
eager interest, which she did not express in words.</p>

<p class='c008'>Abel Force read this paragraph at the head of the
death list:</p>

<p class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Died.</span>—On Monday, August 10th, at Anglewood
Manor, in the forty-fourth year of his age, after a long
and painful illness, which he bore with heroic patience
and fortitude, Col. the Hon. Angus Anglesea.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dead!” muttered Elfrida Force, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dead!” echoed Odalite, gravely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes! dead and—doomed!” exclaimed Abel Force,
catching himself up before he had used an inadmissible
word.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“Then, thank Heaven, I am free! Oh! I hope it was
no sin to say that!” exclaimed Odalite.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her father stared at her for a moment, and then
said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear, you were always free!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I could not feel so while that man lived,” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, what claim could the husband of another
woman set up on you?” demanded Mr. Force, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“None whatever,” replied Elfrida Force, answering
for her daughter; “but after all that she has gone
through, it is perfectly natural that a delicate and sensitive
girl, like Odalite, should have felt ill at ease so
long as her artful and unscrupulous enemy lived, and
should feel a sense of relief at his departure.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose so,” said Abel Force, who was scanning
the first page of the Angleton paper. “And I suppose,
also, that none of us exactly share ‘the profound gloom’
which, according to this sheet, ‘has spread like an
eclipse over all the land, on the death of her illustrious
son.’ The leading article here is on the death of Anglesea,
with a brief sketch of his life and career, and such
a high eulogium as should only have been pronounced
upon the memory of some illustrious hero, martyr,
Christian, or philanthropist. But, then, this Angleton
paper was, of course, his own organ, and in his own interests,
and in those of his family, or it would never
have committed itself to such fulsome flatteries, even
of the dead, whom it seems lawful to praise and justifiable
to overpraise.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Read it, Abel,” said Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, do, papa, dear,” added Odalite.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force read:</p>

<p class='c011'>“THE GREAT SOLDIER OF INDIA IS NO MORE</p>

<p class='c011'>“A profound gloom, a vast pall of darkness, like
some ‘huge eclipse of sun and moon,’ has fallen upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>the land at the death of her illustrious son. Col. the
Hon. Angus Anglesea died yesterday at his manor of
Anglewood.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Hon. Angus Anglesea was born at Anglewood
Manor, on November 21, 181—. He entered Eton at
the early age of twelve years and Oxford at seventeen.
He graduated with the highest honors, at the age of
twenty-two. He succeeded his father on December 23,
182—. His tastes led him to a military career, and he
entered the army as cornet in the Honorable East India
Company’s service, in his twenty-fifth year. His distinguished
military talents, his heroism and gallantry, his
invaluable services during the Indian campaign, are
matters that have passed into national history; and become
so familiar to all that it would be impertinent to
attempt to recapitulate them here.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Col. Anglesea married, firstly, on October 13, 184—,
Lady Mary Merland, eldest daughter of the sixth Earl
of Middlemoor; by whom he has one son, Alexander,
born September 1, 184—, now at Eton. Her ladyship
died August 31, 185—. Col. Anglesea married, secondly,
December 20, 185—, Odalite, eldest daughter of
Abel Force, Esq., of Mondreer, Maryland, United
States, by Lady Elfrida Glennon, eldest daughter of the
late Earl of Enderby, who survives him. There is no
issue by the second marriage.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Abel Force finished reading, dropped the paper and
stared at his wife and daughter, who were also staring
at him. All three seemed struck dumb with astonishment
at the audacity of the last paragraph.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who is responsible for that?” demanded Mrs. Force,
who was the first to find her voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The reckless braggart who has gone to the devil, I
suppose! No one else could be,” said Abel Force, indignantly.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“You are right. No one but Anglesea could have been
the originator of such a falsehood.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And here is no mention made at all of the real second
marriage and of the real widow; whom, by the way,
he must have married within a few weeks after the death
of his wife. Yet! let us see! Great Heaven! unless
there is a misprint, there has been an infamous crime
committed, and a heinous wrong done to that Californian
widow, whose marriage with Col. Anglesea was
registered to have taken place on August 1, 185—, full
six weeks before the death of Anglesea’s wife, which
took place on August 25th! And in that case—yes, in
that case the diabolical villain had the legal right, if
not the moral right, to marry our daughter! Great
Heaven! how imperfect are the laws of our highest civilization,
when men have the legal right to do that which
is morally wrong!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! oh! I will never acknowledge the validity of
that marriage ceremony! I will never call myself that
man’s widow, or wear a thread of mourning for him!”
exclaimed Odalite, who could be very brave now that her
mother’s great enemy was dead, and her mother forever
safe from his malignity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You need not, my dear. Nor need the poor Californian
woman ever suspect that any darker wrong than the
robbery of her money has been done her. Why, either,
should we be so excited over this discovery? It is no
new villainy that has come to light. It is simply that
he really wronged the Californian widow instead of you.
The man is dead. Let us not harbor malice against the
dead. He can harm us no more,” said Abel, in his
wish to soothe the excited feelings of his wife and
daughter. But ah! he knew nothing of the greater cause
those two unhappy ladies had had for their detestation
of their deadly enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>But now he was gone forever, and they were delivered
from his deviltries. It was</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The thrill of a great deliverance”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>that so deeply moved them both. All felt it, even Mr.
Force, who soon arose and went out for a walk to reflect
coolly over the news of the morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Elfrida and Odalite went into the house and tried to
occupy themselves with the question of luncheon and
other household matters, but they could not interest
themselves in any work; they could think of nothing but
of the blessed truth that a great burden had been lifted
from their hearts, a great darkness had passed away
from their minds.</p>

<p class='c008'>Late in the afternoon Wynnette, Elva and Rosemary
came in from school.</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite told them that Col. Anglesea was dead, and
showed them the paper containing the notice of his death
and the sketch of his life.</p>

<p class='c008'>At first the children received the news in silent incredulity,
to be succeeded by the reverential awe with
which the young and happy hear of death and the grave.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette was the first to recover herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! Odalite, I am glad, for your sake, that you are
freed from the incubus of that man’s life. I hope it is
no sin to say this, for I cannot help feeling so,” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope the poor sinner truly repented of his iniquity
and found grace even at the eleventh hour,” breathed the
pitiful little Elva.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know,” sighed quaint little Rosemary, folding
her mites of hands with sad solemnity. “I don’t
know. It is an awful risk for any one, more particularly
for a man like Col. Anglesea.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘The vilest sinner may return,’ you know,” pleaded
Elva.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, he may, but he don’t often do it,” said Wynnette,
putting in her word.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“Let me read the notice of his death and the sketch
of his life,” suggested Odalite, for she had only shown
them the paper containing these articles.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, do, Odalite,” said Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite read the brief notice, and then she turned to
the sketch and said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is longer, and I need not read the whole of it,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No. Just pick out the plums from the pudding. I
never read the whole of anything. Life is too short,”
said Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>The other two girls seemed to agree with her, and so
Odalite began and read the highly inflated eulogium on
Col. Anglesea’s character and career.</p>

<p class='c008'>The three younger ones listened with eyes and mouths
open with astonishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, they seem to think he was a good, wise, brave
man!” gasped little Elva.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s because they knew nothing about him,” exclaimed
Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t there something in the Bible about a man being
a good man among his own people, but turning into a
very bad man when he gets into a strange city where the
people don’t know who he is?” inquired Rosemary, very
gravely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe there is, in the Old Testament somewhere,
but I don’t know where,” answered Elva.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was the way with Anglesea, I suspect. He was
a hypocrite in his own country; but as soon as he came
abroad he cut loose and kicked up his heels—I mean he
threw off all the restraints of honor and conscience,” explained
Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite resumed her task, and read of Anglesea’s
birth, his entrance into Eton, and afterward at Oxford,
his succession to his estates, his entrance into the army,
his marriage to Lady Mary Merland, the birth of his
son, and the death of his wife.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>There she stopped. She did not see fit to read the
paragraph relating to herself; and to prevent her sisters
from seeing it, she rolled up the paper and put it into
her pocket.</p>

<p class='c008'>They did not suspect that there had been any mention
made of his attempted marriage to Odalite, far less that
it had been recorded there as an accomplished fact; but
they wondered why his marriage to the lady of ‘Wild
Cats’ had not been mentioned.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And is there not a word said about his Californian
nuptials?” demanded Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, not a word,” replied Odalite.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah! you see, he wasn’t proud of that second wife!
She wasn’t an earl’s daughter!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder how Mrs. Anglesea will take the news of
her husband’s death, when she hears of it,” mused Elva.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah!” breathed Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>Their talk was interrupted by the entrance of their
father, who had just come in from his long walk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, papa!” exclaimed Wynnette, “we have just
heard the news! Oh! won’t Le be glad when he hears
it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear children,” said Mr. Force, very solemnly
and also a little inconsistently, “we should never rejoice
at any good that may come to us through the death or
misfortune of a fellow creature.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, oh, papa! in this case we can’t help it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s the dinner bell,” said Abel Force, irrelevantly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <span class='large'>THE EARL OF ENDERBY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Washington City in the month of September is very
quiet and sleepy. The torrid heat of the summer is passing
away, but has not passed.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>It returns in hot waves when the incense of its burning
seems to rise to heaven.</p>

<p class='c008'>No one goes out in the sun who is not obliged to go,
or does anything else he or she is not obliged to do.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Forces lived quietly in their city home during
this month, neither making nor receiving calls.</p>

<p class='c008'>The subject of Col. Anglesea’s death and of Le’s return
very naturally occupied much of their thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le was expected home at the end of the three years
voyage—then, or thereabouts, no one knew exactly the
day, or even the week.</p>

<p class='c008'>Letters notifying him of the death of Angus Anglesea
were promptly written to him by every member of
the family, so eager were they all to convey the news
and express themselves on the subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even little Elva wrote, and her letter contained a
characteristic paragraph:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am almost afraid it is a sin to be so very glad, as
I am that Odalite is now entirely free from the fear that
has haunted her and oppressed her spirits and darkened
her mind for nearly three years. I cannot help feeling
glad when I see Odalite looking so bright, happy and
hopeful, just as she used to look before that man bewitched
her. But I know I ought to be sorry for him,
and indeed I am, just a little. Maybe he couldn’t help
being bad—maybe he didn’t have Christian parents. I
do hope he repented and found grace before he died.
But Rosemary shakes her head and sighs over him. But,
then, you know, Rosemary is such a solemn little thing
over anything serious—though she can be funny enough
at times. Oh, how I wish it was lawful to pray for the
dead! Then I would pray for that man every hour in
the day. And now I will tell you a secret, or—make
you a confession: I do pray for him every night, and
then I pray to the Lord that if it is a sin for me to pray
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>for the dead He will forgive me for praying for that
man. Oh, Le! how we that call ourselves Christians
should try to save sinners while they live!”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was on a Saturday, near the middle of October,
when answering letters came from Le—a large packet—directed
to Mr. Force, but containing letters for each
one. They were jubilant letters, filled full of life, and
love, and hope. Not one regret for the dead man! not
one hope that he had repented and found grace, as little
Elva expressed it. Clearly, Le was one of those Christians
who can rejoice in the just perdition of the lost.</p>

<p class='c008'>His ship was at Rio Janeiro, on her return voyage,
he wrote, and he expected to be home to eat his Christmas
dinner with the uncle, aunt and cousins who were
soon to be his father, mother, wife and sisters. The
New Year’s wedding that was to have come off three
years ago should be celebrated on the coming New Year
with more éclat than had ever attended a wedding before.
Now he would resign from the navy, and settle
down with his dear Odalite at Greenbushes, where it
would be in no man’s power to disturb their peace.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le wrote in very much the same vein to every member
of the family, for, as has been seen in the first part
of this story, there never was such a frank, simple and
confiding pair of lovers as these two who had been
brought up together, and whose letters were read by
father, mother and sisters, aunt, uncle and cousins.</p>

<p class='c008'>To Elva, in addition to other things, he wrote: “Don’t
trouble your gentle heart about the fate of Anglesea.
Leave him to the Lord. No man is ever removed from
this earth until it is best for him and everybody else that
he should go. Then he goes and he cannot go before.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is all very well to say,” murmured poor Elva;
“but, all the same, when I remember how much I wished—something
would happen to him—for Odalite’s sake, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>cannot help feeling as if I had somehow helped to kill
him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, perhaps you did,” said Wynnette. “I believe
the most gentle and tender angels are all unconsciously
the most terrible destroyers of the evil. I have read
somewhere or other that the most malignant and furious
demon from the deepest pit will turn tail and—no,
I mean will fly, howling in pain, wrath and terror, from
before the face of a naked infant! Ah! there are wonderful
influences in the invisible world around us. You
may have been his Uriel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I didn’t want to be—I didn’t want to be!” said
Elva, almost in tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, you didn’t want to be while you were awake and
in your natural state; but how do you know, now, what
you wanted to be when you were asleep and in your
spiritual condition?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Elva opened her large, blue eyes with such amazement
that Wynnette burst out laughing.</p>

<p class='c008'>And nothing more was said on the subject at that
time, because Mr. Force, who had left a pile of other
unopened letters on the table while they read and discussed
Le’s, now took up one from the pile, looked at it,
and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, Elfrida, my dear, here is a letter from England
for you. It is sealed with the Enderby crest.
From your brother, no doubt.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The first I have had for years,” said the lady, as
she took the letter from her husband’s hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was directed in the style that would have been used
had the earl’s sister lived in England:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It had been forwarded from the country post office to
the city:</p>

<p class='c008'>Elfrida opened it and read:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>“<span class='sc'>Enderby Castle</span>, October 1, 186—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>My Dear and Only Sister</span>: I have no apology to
offer you for my long neglect of your regular letters,
except that of the sad <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis inertia</span></i> of the confirmed invalid.
That I know you will accept with charity and
sympathy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am lower in health, strength and spirits than ever
before. I employ an amanuensis to write all my letters,
except those to you.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shrink from having a stranger intermeddling with
a correspondence between an only brother and sister,
and so, because I was not able to write with my own
hand, your letters have been unanswered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In none of them, however, have you mentioned any
present or prospective establishment of any of your girls,
except that, years ago, you spoke of an early, very early
betrothal of your eldest daughter to a young naval officer.
You have not alluded to that arrangement lately.
Has that come to nothing? It was scarcely a match befitting
one who will some day, should she live, be my successor
here.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your girls must have grown up in all these years.
Let us see. Odalite must be nineteen, Wynnette seventeen,
and little Elva fifteen. Two of them, therefore,
must be marriageable, according to Maryland notions.
Write and tell me all about them. And tell me whether
you will come into my views that I am about to open to
you.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am lonely, very lonely, not having a near relative
in the world, except yourself and your family. I want
you all to come over and make me a long visit, and then
try to make up your minds to the magnanimity of leaving
one of your girls with me for so long as I may have
to live; or, if one girl would feel lonesome, leave two, to
keep each other company. You and your husband might
be quite happy with one daughter at home.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So I think. What do you?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>“My plan may be only the selfish wish of a chronic
sufferer, who is nearly always sure to be an egotist. Consult
your husband, and write to me.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Give my love to my nieces, and kindest regards to
Mr. Force, and believe me, ever, dear Elfrida,</p>

      <div class='line'>“Your affectionate brother,</div>
      <div class='line in24'>“<span class='sc'>Enderby</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Force having read the letter to herself, passed
it over without a word of comment to her husband.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force also read it in silence, and then returned
it to his wife, saying:</p>

<p class='c008'>“This matter requires mature deliberation. We will
think over it to-night, and decide to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Or, as to-morrow is the Sabbath, we will write and
give my brother our answer on Monday,” amended the
lady.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, that will be better. It will give us more time
to mature our plans,” assented Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it?” inquired Wynnette, drawing near her
parents, while Elva and Rosemary looked the interest
that they did not put into words.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A letter from your Uncle Enderby, my dears, inviting
us all to come over and make him a long visit.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! that would be delightful, mamma. Can we not
go?” eagerly inquired Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps. You will all graduate at the end of this
current term, and then, perhaps, we can go with advantage,
but not before.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, that will be joyful, joyful, joyful!” sang Wynnette,
in the words of a revival hymn.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what will Le and Odalite do?” inquired little
Elva, who always thought of everybody.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, if Le and Odalite are to be married in January
they can go over there for the bridal trip, you know,”
said Wynnette. “They will have to go somewhere on a
wedding tour—all brides and grooms have to—and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>reason why is because for the first few weeks after marriage
they are such insupportable idiots that no human
beings can possibly endure their presence. My private
opinion is that they ought to be sent to a lunatic asylum
to spend the honeymoon; but as that cannot be done,
we can send our poor idiots over to Uncle Enderby.
Maybe by the time they have crossed the ocean seasickness
may have brought them to their senses.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you, for myself and Le,” said Odalite, laughing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Without joking, I really think your plan is a good
one,” said Mrs. Force. “Whether we all follow in June
or not, it will be an acceptable attention to my brother
to send our son and daughter over to spend their honeymoon
at Enderby Castle.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was more conversation, that need not be reported
here, except to say that all agreed to the plan of
the wedding trip.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the following Monday, Mr. and Mrs. Force, having
come to a decision, wrote a joint letter to the Earl
of Enderby, cordially thanking him for his invitation,
gladly accepting it, and explaining that the marriage of
their daughter, Odalite, with Mr. Leonidas Force, would
probably come off in January, after which the young
pair would sail for England on a visit to Enderby Castle.
That if all should go well, after the two younger girls
should have graduated from their academy, the whole
family would follow in June, and join at the castle.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would be curious, at the moment we close a letter
to some distant friend, could we look in and see what,
at that moment, the friend might be doing.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the instant that Mr. Force sealed the envelope to
the Earl of Enderby, could he have been clairvoyant, he
might have looked in upon the library of Enderby Castle
and seen the sunset light streaming through a richly
stained oriel window upon the thin, pale, patrician face
and form of a man of middle age, who sat wrapped in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>an Indian silk dressing gown, reclining in a deeply cushioned
easy-chair, and reading a newspaper—the London
<cite>Evening Telegram</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>And this is what the Earl of Enderby read:</p>

<p class='c011'>“We take pleasure in announcing that Col. the Hon.
Angus Anglesea has been appointed deputy lieutenant
governor of the county.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <span class='large'>ANTICIPATIONS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>With the assembling of Congress, in the first week of
December, the usual crowd of officials, pleasure-seekers,
fortune hunters, adventurers and adventuresses poured
into Washington. Hotels, boarding houses and private
dwellings were full.</p>

<p class='c008'>The serious business of fashion and the light recreation
of legislation began.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force went down to the capitol every day to listen
to the disputes in the House or in the Senate.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Force and Odalite drove out to call on such of
their friends and acquaintances as had arrived in the
city, and to leave cards for the elder lady’s “day”—the
Wednesday of each week during the season.</p>

<p class='c008'>Letters came from Le. His ship was still delayed for
an indefinite time at Rio de Janeiro, waiting sailing
orders, which seemed to be slow in coming.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le’s letters betrayed the fact that he was fretting and
fuming over the delay.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t know what the navy department means,” he
wrote, “keeping us here for no conceivable purpose under
the sun. But I know what I mean. I mean to resign
as soon as ever I get home.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“If there should come a war I will serve my country,
of course; but in these ‘piping times of peace’ I will not
stay in the service to be anybody’s nigger, even Uncle
Sam’s!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite, Wynnette and Elva cheered him up with frequent
letters.</p>

<p class='c008'>Christmas is rather a quiet interlude in the gay life of
Washington.</p>

<p class='c008'>Congress adjourns until after New Year.</p>

<p class='c008'>Most of the government officials—members of the administration
and of both houses of Congress, and many
of the civil service brigade, leave the city to spend their
holidays in their distant homesteads.</p>

<p class='c008'>In fact, there is an exodus until after New Year.</p>

<p class='c008'>The gay season in Washington does not really begin
until after the first of January.</p>

<p class='c008'>The public receptions by the President and by the
members of the cabinet take the initiative.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then follow receptions by members of the diplomatic
corps, by prominent senators and representatives, and by
wealthy or distinguished private citizens.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr., Mrs. and Miss Force went everywhere, and received
everybody—within the limits of their social circle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite, for the first time in her short life, enjoyed
society with a real youthful zest.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no drawback now. Her mother’s deadly
enemy had passed to his account, and could trouble her
no more, she thought. Le was coming home, and they
were to be married soon, and go to Europe and see all
the beauties and splendors and glories of the Old World,
which she so longed to view. They were to sojourn in
the old, ancestral English home which had been the scene
of her mother’s childhood—ah! and the scene of so many
exploits of her ancestors—sieges, defenses, captures, recoveries,
confiscations by this ruler, restorations by that—events
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>which had passed into history and helped to
make it. She would see London—wonderful, mighty
London!—St. Paul’s, the Tower. Oh! and Paris, and
the old Louvre!—Rome! St. Peter’s! the Coliseum! the
Catacombs!—places which the facilities of modern
travel have made as common as a market house to most
of the educated world, but which, to this imaginative,
country girl, were holy ground, sacred monuments, wonderful,
most wonderful relics of a long since dead and
gone world.</p>

<p class='c008'>And Le would be her companion in all these profound
enjoyments! And, after all, they should return home
and settle down at Greenbushes, never to part again, but
to be near neighbors to father, mother, sisters and
friends; to give and receive all manner of neighborly
kindnesses, courtesies, hospitalities.</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite’s heart was as full of happy thoughts as is a
hive of honey bees. Her happiness beamed from her
face, shining on all who approached her.</p>

<p class='c008'>If Odalite had been admired during the two past seasons
when she was pale, quiet and depressed, how much
more was she admired now in her fair, blooming beauty,
that seemed to bring sunshine, life and light into every
room she entered.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Force felt all a mother’s pride in the social success
of her daughter.</p>

<p class='c008'>But to Odalite herself the proudest and happiest day
of the whole season was that on which she received a
letter from Le, announcing his immediate return home.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This letter,” he wrote, “will go by the steamer that
leaves this port on the thirteenth of January. We have
our sailing orders for the first of February. On that
day we leave this blessed port homeward bound. Winds
and waves propitious, we shall arrive early in March,
and then—and then, Odalite——”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>And then the faithful lover and prospective bridegroom
went off into the extravagances that were to be
expected, even of him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite received this letter on the first of February,
and knew that on that day Le had sailed, homeward
bound.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He will be here some time in the first week of
March,” said Mrs. Force, in talking over the letter with
her daughter. “Congress will have adjourned by the
fourth. All strangers will have left. The city will be
quiet. It will be in the midst of Lent also. I think,
Odalite, that, under all the circumstances, we had better
have a very private wedding, here in our city home,
with none but our family and most intimate friends
present. Then you and Le will sail for Europe, make
the grand tour, and after that shall be finished, go to my
brother at Enderby Castle, where we—your father, and
sisters, and myself—will join you in the autumn. What
do you think?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think as you do, mamma, and would much prefer
the marriage to be as quiet as possible,” Odalite assented.</p>

<p class='c008'>“After you and Le leave us we shall still remain in
the city until the girls shall have graduated. Then we
will go down to the dear old home for a few weeks, and
then sail for Liverpool, to join you at Enderby Castle.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is an enchanting program, mamma! Oh! I
hope we may be able to carry it through!” exclaimed
Odalite.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There is no reason in the world why we should not,
my dear,” replied the lady.</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite sighed, with a presentiment of evil which she
could neither comprehend nor banish.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now,” said her mother, “I must sit down and
write to Mrs. Anglesea and to Mr. Copp. The house at
Mondreer will need to be prepared for us. It wanted
repairs badly enough when we left it. It must be in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>worse condition now; so I must write at once to give
them time enough to have the work done well.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And she retired to her own room to go about her task.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Wynnette, Elva and Rosemary came home in
the afternoon, and heard that Le had sailed from Rio de
Janeiro, and would certainly be home early in March,
they were wild with delight.</p>

<p class='c008'>When, upon much cross-examination of Odalite, they
found out that the marriage of the young lovers was to
be quietly performed in the parlor of their father’s
house, and that the newly married pair would immediately
sail for Europe in advance of the family, who
were to join them at Enderby Castle later on, their
ecstasies took forms strongly suggestive of Darwin’s
theory concerning the origin of the species. In other
words, they danced and capered all over the drawing
room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We want Rosemary to go with us, papa, dear,” said
Elva.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We must have Rosemary to go with us, you know,
mamma,” added Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is not for us to say,” replied Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is a question for her mother and her aunt,” added
Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the little girls did not yield the point. Rosemary’s
three years’ association with them had made her
as dear to Wynnette and Elva as a little sister. And
when they found out that Rosemary was heartbroken
at the prospect of parting from them, and “wild” to
accompany them, they stuck to their point with the pertinacity
of little terriers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now what could Abel Force—the kindest-hearted
man on the face of the earth, perhaps—do but yield to
the children’s innocent desire?</p>

<p class='c008'>He wrote to Mrs. Hedge and to Miss Grandiere, proposing
to those ladies to take Rosemary with his daughters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>to Europe, to give her the educational advantage
of the tour.</p>

<p class='c008'>In due time came the answer of the sisters, full of
surprise and gratitude for the generous offer, which
they accepted in the simple spirit in which it was made.</p>

<p class='c008'>And when Wynnette, Elva and Rosemary were informed
of the decision there were not three happier girls
in the whole world than themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>The same mail brought a letter from the housekeeper
at Mondreer, who was ever a very punctual correspondent.</p>

<p class='c008'>She informed Mrs. Force that such internal improvements
as might be made in bad weather were already
progressing at Mondreer—that all the bedsteads were
down, and all the carpets up, the floors had been
scrubbed, and the windows and painting washed, and
the kalsominers were at work.</p>

<p class='c008'>But she wanted to know immediately, if Mrs. Force
pleased, what that news was that she was saving for a
personal interview. If it concerned her own “beat,” she
would like to know it at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, I thought you had told her, mamma,” said
Odalite, when she had read this letter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, my dear. I did not wish to excite any new talk
of Angus Anglesea until you and Le should be married
and off to Europe. I shrink from the subject, Odalite.
I am sorry now that I hinted to the woman having
anything to tell her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, mamma, ought she not be told that he is dead?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He has been dead to her since he left her. In good
time she shall know that he is dead to us also. And,
my dear, remember that he was not her husband, after
all, but——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! don’t finish the sentence, mamma! What will
Le say?” sighed Odalite.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing. This will make no difference to you or to
Le. That ceremony performed at All Faith, three years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>ago, whether legal or illegal, was certainly incomplete—the
marriage rites arrested before the registry was made.
You have never seen or spoken to the would-be bridegroom
since that hour; and now the man is dead, and
you are free, even if you were ever bound. Let us hear
no more on that subject, my dear. Now I shall have to
answer this letter, and—as I have been so unlucky as to
have raised the woman’s suspicions and set her to talking—I
must tell her the facts, I suppose. And—as for her
sake as well as for our own, I choose to consider her
the widow of Angus Anglesea—I shall send with the
letter a widow’s outfit,” concluded the lady, as she left
the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole remainder of that day was spent by Mrs.
Force in driving along Pennsylvania Avenue and up
Seventh Street, selecting from the best stores an appropriate
outfit in mourning goods for the colonel’s widow.</p>

<p class='c008'>These were all sent home in the evening, carefully
packed in a large deal box, which, with a letter at its
bottom, was dispatched by express to Mrs. Angus Anglesea,
Charlotte Hall, Maryland.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <span class='large'>VALENTINES AT MONDREER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was the fourteenth of February, St. Valentine’s
Feast and All Birds’ Wedding Day!</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a bright morning, with a sunny blue sky, and
a soft breeze giving a foretaste of early spring.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Sibby Bayard had come by special invitation to
dine, and take tea with the housekeeper at Mondreer.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two ladies were seated in Mrs. Force’s favorite
sitting room, whose front window looked east upon the
bay, and whose side window looked north into the woods.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>A bright, open wood fire was burning in the wide fireplace,
at which they sat in two rocking-chairs with their
feet upon the brass fender.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Anglesea had the edge of her skirt drawn up as
usual, for, as she often declared, she would rather toast
her shins before the fire than eat when she was hungry,
or sleep when she was sleepy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Sibby was knitting one of a pair of white lamb’s-wool
socks for her dear Roland.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Anglesea was letting out the side seams of her
Sunday basque.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is the most aggravating thing in this world that I
seem to be always a-letting out of seams, and yet always
a-having my gown bodies split somewhere or other when
I put them on!” said the widow, apropos of her work,
as she laid the open seam over her knee and began
smoothing it out with her chubby fingers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re gettin’ too fat, that’s where it is. You’re
gettin’ a great deal too fat,” remarked plain-spoken Miss
Sibby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well! That’s just what I’m complaining of! I’m
getting so fat that the people make fun of me behind my
back; they’d better not try it on before my face, I can
tell them that!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do you know they make fun of you at all?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“By instick! I know it. And besides, this very morning,
when Jake came from the post office, what did he
fetch me? Not the letter from the old ’oman, as I was
a-hoping and a-praying for! No! but a big onwelope
with a impident walentine in it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A walentine!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, ma’am! A most impident one! A woman—no—a
haystack dressed up like me, with impident verses
under it! I wish I knowed who sent it! I’d give ’em
walentines and haystacks, too, for their impidence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, don’t yer mind that! It was some boys or
other! Boys is the devil, sez I, and you need never to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>expect nothing better from them, sez I! You can’t get
blood out’n a turnip, sez I! nor likewise make a silk
purse out’n a sow’s ear, sez I, and no more can’t you expect
nothing out’n boys but the devil. Why, la! I got a
wuss walentine than yourn! Found it tucked underneath
of the front door this morning. Jest look at it!”
said Miss Sibby, drawing a folded paper out of her
pocket, opening and displaying it to her companion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“See here,” she continued, pointing out its features as
she spread it on her knee. “Here a tower, with a man
on the top of it and a crown on the head of him, and
his arms stretched out just as he has chucked an old
’oman over the wall! And here’s the old ’oman halfway
down to the ground with her hands and feet flying. And
onderneath of it all is wrote, ‘Descended from a duke.’
That’s meant for me, you know! It’s a harpoon on me
and the Duke of England! But I don’t mind it! Not
I! It’s nothing but their envy, sez I. The birds will
pick at the highest fruit, sez I!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think they ought to be well thrashed! Wish I had
hold of ’em!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lemme see yourn!” said Miss Sibby.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Anglesea stood up and took a folded paper from
under one of the silver candlesticks on the mantelpiece
and handed it to her visitor.</p>

<p class='c008'>A haystack, dressed in Mrs. Anglesea’s style and
crowned with her head, and not a very violent caricature
of her face. Evidently, like Miss Sibby’s valentine, the
work of some waggish amateur.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s the truth of the thing that gets me. I am getting
to be a haystack,” said Mrs. Anglesea.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, what do you do it for?” inquired Miss Sibby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How can I help it?” demanded her companion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Reggerlate your habits. Do by yourself as you do
by the animyles, sez I!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t understand you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’ll try to ’splain. When we want to fatten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>fowl, we shut ’em up in coops so they can’t move round
much; and we feed ’em full, don’t we?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And when we want to fatten pigs, we shut ’em up
in pens so they can’t run round much, and we feed ’em
full, don’t we?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes! But what of that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, them innicent fowls and quadruples are our
kinfolks in the flesh, if they ain’t in the spirit anyways,
and what’s law to them is law to us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re too deep for me, ole ’oman!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, then, to come to the p’int——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, down to hard pan.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you want to get fatter and fatter, till you can’t
pass through ne’er a door in this house, you keep eating
as much as you can, and sitting into rocking-chairs as
long as possible!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Lord!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you’ll keep on a-getting fatter and fatter, until—until
you’d do to go round the country in a show.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Lord! Next time I see young Dr. Ingle I’ll ask
him wot sort o’ vittels produces fat and wot’ll make only
skin and bone and muscle,” said the widow, in dismay.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I reckon you’d better do that! It’s getting dangerous
in your case, you know! As for me, I am fat
enough; but never too fat. I always wariate betwixt a
hund’ed and twenty-five to a hund’ed and thirty. But I
never go beyond a hund’ed and thirty. Moderation is a
jewel, sez I! Lord! here’s somebody a-coming! Who is
it, I wonder?” exclaimed Miss Sibby, breaking off in her
discourse and going to the front window. “Why, it’s
Tommy Grandiere! And he and Jake a-bringin’ in of a
big box!” she continued, as the “carryall” stopped before
the door, and the farmer and the servant lifted
down a box.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s new curtains, or rugs, or something for the house.
They’re alluss a-coming,” observed Mrs. Anglesea.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>As she spoke the door opened, and Jake’s head appeared,
while Jake’s voice said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Ere’s Marse Tom Grander, mum.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Grandiere entered the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-day, Mrs. Anglesea! Miss Sibby, glad to see
you! I was up at Charlotte’s Hall this morning, and
saw a box at the express office for you. As I was coming
down this way, and thought maybe it would be a
convenience to you for me to fetch it along, I just gave
a receipt for it and fetched it. So here it is in the hall.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thank you, sir, which it is a convenience! Not
knowing as there was a box there for me, I might have
left it for a week. Thanky’, sir! Won’t you sit down?”
inquired Mrs. Anglesea, placing a chair for the newcomer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I thank you, ma’am. I have to go. But I
would like to ask: Have you heard from Mr. and Mrs.
Force lately?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not for ’most a fortnight. But they are coming
down in June.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In June? Yes, so I heard. Good-morning, Mrs.
Anglesea. Good-morning, Miss Sibby.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And the visitor hurried away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s in that box, do you think?” inquired Miss
Sibby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, curtains, or stair carpet, or rugs, or something
for the house! They are allus a-coming! Only I ’most
in general get a letter first to tell me where to send for
them,” said Mrs. Anglesea.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I would like to see the pattern o’ them rugs and curtains
and things! Fashions do change so much, I would
ralely like to see what the present fashion is! Ef you
don’t keep up with the times, sez I, the times will leave
you behind, sez I!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we’ll open the box after dinner, Miss Sibby,
but we can’t before. Dinner is ready to go on the table
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>now, and it mustn’t be spoiled by keeping. It’s spring
lamb and spinach, raised under glass——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Spring lamb and spinach the fourteenth of February!
Never!” exclaimed the descendant of the Howards.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, but it is. Having the conveniences to do it
with, I don’t see why we shouldn’t have the luxuries.
Having the hotbeds, why not the spinach? That’s what
I say to Jake and to Luce. And let me tell you them
niggers live just as well as I do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lamb and spinach!” gasped Miss Sibby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And that ain’t all. Fresh fish, caught in the bay
this morning, to begin with. And meringo pudding to
finish off with. And a good bottle of wine to go all the
way through with it. It isn’t often as I meddle with
the wine cellar, though the ole man and ’oman did tell
me to help myself—give me <em>carte wheel</em>, as they called
it, to do as I please with what’s left in the vault. Most
of it, to be sure, was took to Washington. Still I never
makes free with the wine, ‘cept on high days and holidays.
And there’s the bell, so now we’ll go in to dinner.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER X<br /> <span class='large'>THE BOX</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i> dinner was greatly enjoyed by these
gossips. They lingered over it as long as it was possible
to do so.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Talkin’ o’ walentines,” said Miss Sibby, apropos of
nothing, “when I was young there wa’n’t no walentines
made to sell. They was only made by ladies with fine
taste for the work. They were cut out of fine paper,
heart-shaped when folded, and scalloped circle when
open, and finified off with ‘lilies and roses and other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>fine posies,’ and with written verses. Ah! I have known
old Mrs. Grandiere—Miss Susannah’s mother—spend
days and days cutting out and decorating walentines for
the young people to send to their sweethearts. And they
was all complimentary, and never impident. No sich
thing as buying of a walentine ever heard of. And now
they’ve got ’em in every shop window. But times
changes, sez I, and them as lives the longest, sez I, sees
the most, sez I.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t think as your valentine or mine came out
of the shops, Miss Sibby. I never seen any like them in
shops. I think they was handmade by some young
vilyun or other.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is so. And the same scamp as made yourn, sez
I, likewise made mine, sez I. And now as we’ve got
done our dinner, hadn’t we might as well go and see
them new-fashioned rugs and things in the box? If you
have got anything to do, sez I, why, go and do it at once,
sez I. Ain’t that so?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and we will go and open the box. Jake, bring
a chisel and a clawhammer here, and life that big box
out o’ the hall into the little parlor,” said the widow,
calling to the one manservant, and then leading the way
back to the sitting room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jake soon appeared with the box—a heavy deal case,
four feet square—on his shoulder, and carefully lowered
it to the floor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now rip off the lid,” said the widow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jake, with considerable labor, opened the box.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now we shall see them new-fashioned rugs. And
if I like ’em, I’ll send to Baltimore by Mark Truman’s
schooner, and buy one to lay before my fireplace, soon’s
ever I get paid for that last hogshead of tobacco,” said
Miss Sibby, as the lid of the box flew up under Jake’s
vigorous applications of the clawhammer.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two women stooped over the open case.</p>

<p class='c008'>First came a roll of coarse brown paper; then a layer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>of finer paper; then a large, folded parcel of bombazine
and crape, which, on being unwrapped, turned out to be
a made-up, deep mourning dress.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, this must be a mistake!” said Mrs. Anglesea.
“This box must have been intended for somebody else.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And she turned up the lid and read the direction
again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No! It is directed to me, sure enough, but it must
be a mistake, all the same. And I reckon the mistake
was made at the store where all the things was bought,
and they misdirected the box, and sent me these things,
and sent them rugs to the party these was intended for.
Lord! how careless people is, to be sure! But now let
us see for curiosity what is in the box.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And while Miss Sibby looked on with the greatest
curiosity, Mrs. Anglesea unpacked the case.</p>

<p class='c008'>More tissue paper; then a folded mantle of bombazine,
trimmed with crape; then a black merino shawl;
then half a dozen pair of black kid gloves; then another
dress of black cashmere; then half a dozen pairs of
black hose; then an inner wooden box, which, being
lifted out and opened, was found to contain two compartments.
In one was a widow’s black crape bonnet,
with long, heavy black crape veil; and in the other a
widow’s cap of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">crêpe lisse</span></i>, and another of fine, white
organdie.</p>

<p class='c008'>When all these were laid out on the table the two
women stood on either side of it, looking at each other
and at the articles before them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I reckon I’d better put ’em all back again, and
wait till I hear from the owner,” said Mrs. Anglesea.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I reckon maybe you better read this letter first. I
think it must have been flung out accidental when the
paper was took off the top of the things in the box,” said
Miss Sibby, as she stooped and picked up a white envelope
from among the waste paper under the table, and
which had just caught her eye.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“To be sure! This is directed to me, too, and in the
handwriting of the ole ’oman, too. Now I wonder I
didn’t see this before. I do reckon now she has sent
these here things down to me to give to some one who
is going in mourning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So saying, Mrs. Anglesea opened the letter, and being
a frank soul, spelled it out aloud:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Washington</span>, February 12, 1882.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>My Dear Mrs. Anglesea</span>: I received your letter,
and hasten to reply. I should have preferred to give
you my serious news in person, but since you insist on
it, I give it you now in writing. Under all the circumstances,
I need not fear even to give you a shock, when
I tell you that Col. Angus Anglesea died at——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good Lord! then the man is dead, sure enough!”
exclaimed the widow, breaking off from her readings
and looking up at her companion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lord ’a’ mercy! So he is! But read on! Don’t
stop! Let’s hear all about it!” exclaimed Miss Sibby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I can’t! I can’t! It seems so strange! He was
so strong and healthy I thought he’d live forever almost!
I thought he’d outlive me, anyways. And now
he’s dead! It don’t seem possible, you know,” said the
widow, with a total change of manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, Lord! I thought you suspicioned as it was
your husband’s death as Mrs. Force was a-keeping from
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I didn’t. It was all my nonsense. I hadn’t a
notion as he could die, and he the perfect pictor of life
and health. And to be cut off in his prime!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, woman, you seem like you was sorry for the
man as robbed and deserted you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t speak of that now, Miss Sibby. It’s mean to
speak ill of the dead, who can’t answer you back again!”
said the widow.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“And now I know you are sorry for him. And yet
you ’lowed if he was dead you would not go into mourning
for him!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, but I didn’t think he was dead then, or that he
would ever die in my lifetime. I—I didn’t know,” said
the widow, in a breaking voice that she tried hard to
steady.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well! them as would understand a widdy, sez I,
need to have a long head, sez I! I knowed as you
was awful tender-hearted and pitiful, Mrs. Anglesea.
But I ralely didn’t think as you’d take on about him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m not taken on about nobody. But a woman
needn’t be a wild Indian, or a heathen, or cannibal, I
reckon. A Christian’s ’lowed to have some sort o’ feelin’s.
Now let me read the rest of my letter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And she resumed the perusal of her epistle, but in
silence. She read all the particulars of Anglesea’s death
as they were given by Mrs. Force in her own writing,
and also in the slips cut from the Angleton <cite>Advertiser</cite>
and inclosed in the letter. All except the concluding
paragraph of the eulogy, giving the statement of his
two marriages. These were cut off, in kindness to her,
who thought herself his lawful wife.</p>

<p class='c008'>When she had finished she gave all into Miss Sibby’s
hands, and sat and watched in moody silence while the
old lady adjusted her spectacles and slowly read them
through.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They speak very highly of the poor man in that there
newspaper. He must have repented of his sins and made
a good end, after all,” said Miss Sibby, very solemnly,
as she returned letters and papers into Mrs. Anglesea’s
hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was very thoughtful of Mrs. Force to send me
down this box of mourning—very thoughtful. And I
am very thankful to her for it,” murmured the widow,
as if speaking to herself.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>“Then you will go in mourning for him?” said Miss
Sibby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I shall.”</p>

<p class='c008'>No more was said just then.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Bayard stayed to tea. And then, seeing that her
friend was very much depressed in spirits, she volunteered
to stay with her all night; a favor for which the
widow was really very grateful.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next morning, however, the elastic spirits of the
lady from the mines had risen to their normal elevation,
and Miss Sibby, with relieved feelings, left Mondreer to
spread the news of Angus Anglesea’s death far and wide
through the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c008'>And it is perfectly safe to say that the woman whom
he had so deeply wronged was the only individual in the
whole community who felt the least pity for his premature
departure.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <span class='large'>“MERRY AS A MARRIAGE BELL”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Congress adjourned on the fourth of March, and
within a week from that time the crowd that always
follows in their wake left Washington, and the city
dropped into comparative repose; for not only were all
the receptions over, the multitude departed, but the season
of Lent was on.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Forces enjoyed this time of rest from the world.
They attended old St. John’s Church three times a week,
and lived quietly between whiles, looking forward with
pleasant anticipations to the arrival of Le, and to all
the delights that were expected to follow that event.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le arrived on Easter Sunday morning. His ship had
reached New York on the day before. He had obtained
leave of absence, and he had only time to catch the latest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>train to Washington, “on the run,” leaving all his luggage
behind him and having not a moment to telegraph
his friends of his approach.</p>

<p class='c008'>He reached the city at twelve o’clock midnight, and
not wishing to wake the family up at that hour, he
took a room at a hotel.</p>

<p class='c008'>But by sunrise the next morning he was up and
dressed, had paid his bill, taken a hack from the sidewalk,
and was on his way to P Street Circle, to look up
his uncle’s city house.</p>

<p class='c008'>That Easter Sunday the family were assembled
around the table in the pleasant breakfast room of their
house, which looked out upon the circle, where already
the parterres were brilliant and fragrant with the earliest
spring flowers—hyacinths, pink, blue and white;
daffodils golden; tulips flame and fire color; jonquils,
like golden cups in silver saucers; bridal wreath; yellow
currant burning bush—all budding, but not yet blooming.
All the grass of a tender emerald green. All the
trees just bursting into leaf. Birds singing only as they
sing on a spring morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a beautiful Easter Sunday is this! Not a
cloud in all the sky!” said Odalite, as she turned from
the window to take her seat at the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force stood up to ask a blessing, but the doorbell
rang sharply and he sat down again.</p>

<p class='c008'>And before any one could put a question the door flew
open and Le rushed in like the wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every one jumped so suddenly from the table that
chairs were overturned in their haste to welcome the
wanderer.</p>

<p class='c008'>There followed much handshaking, hugging and kissing,
rather mixed and confused, until Le found Odalite
in his arms. Then he came to a stop and held her there
while he answered questions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hadn’t an idea your ship was near port. When did
you get in?” inquired Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“Anchored yesterday at half-past two, got leave, and
caught the three train. Hadn’t time to telegraph, or
even to pack a portmanteau. Can any one lend me the
loan of a clean change of linen?” inquired Le, with a
look of distress.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course! You shall go to my room and help yourself.
But you don’t look much in want,” replied his
uncle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now sit down, Le. We were just about to begin
breakfast when you came in,” said Mrs. Force, as the
manservant in attendance placed another chair at the
table for the newcomer.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was silence for a few moments while Mr. Force
said the grace.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the confusion of Babel began again. All asked
questions, and without waiting for them to be answered,
asked others. Wynnette and Elva, who were home for
the Easter holidays, seemed to run a race with their
tongues as to which could talk fastest and most. Mr.
and Mrs. Force had much to ask and to tell. Odalite,
and even quaint, little Rosemary, put in a word when
they could get a chance.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is always so when a sailor returns from a long voyage
to his family circle.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was but little breakfast eaten that morning,
though they lingered long at the table—so long that,
at length, Mrs. Force felt obliged to ask the question:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you going to church with us this morning, Le?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I am, auntie. I should be worse than a
heathen not to go, if it were only to give thanks for my
safe and joyful arrival at home,” replied the young man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is right, my boy. I like to see you hold fast to
the faith and practice of your forefathers in this untoward
generation,” said Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, then, since you are going with us, Le, dear,
you had better get ready. We have but little time,”
advised the lady.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“Come with me to my room, Le. My underclothing
will fit you well enough, I am sure. Bless you, my boy!
you have caught up to me in size,” said Mr. Force, as he
arose from the table to conduct the midshipman.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ladies of the circle also went to their chambers to
get ready for church.</p>

<p class='c008'>And this was Le’s welcome home.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette, Elva and Rosemary had a week’s holiday
with which they were all the more delighted because of
their dear Le’s presence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although, as in love and duty bound, he devoted himself
almost exclusively to Odalite, yet he found time to
take a little notice of his younger friends—to tell them
how much they had grown, how greatly they had improved,
how womanly they had become since he saw
them three years before, and so on and so on.</p>

<p class='c008'>During this week the preparations for Leonidas and
Odalite’s marriage were discussed.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was decided that the wedding should take place
on the first of April.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All Fools’ Day! What a commentary!” exclaimed
Wynnette, when she learned the decision.</p>

<p class='c008'>No one had thought of its being All Fools’ Day when
the date was fixed; and now that it was so fixed, the
circumstance was somewhat too trivial to warrant any
change in the time. So on the first of April the happy
event was appointed to come off.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should like to ask Roland Bayard to come up to be
my groomsman,” said Le, to no one in particular, since
he spoke in full family council.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, I thought he was at sea!” said Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, uncle, he has just got home. I had a letter from
him this morning. He had seen the arrival of my ship
in the papers and naturally addressed his letters here. I
suppose his aunt gave him your address.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Quite likely. She knew it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Queer, isn’t it?” ruminated Le. “Roland and I do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>happen to make our voyages and returns simultaneously,
or nearly so, and without any possibility of intended
concert of action.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, if you happen to start about the same time for
a voyage of the same length, you will be apt to return
about the same time, I suppose!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I suppose so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now, Le, my boy, in regard to inviting young
Bayard here, do so, by all means. Ask any of your particular
friends. And ask them to come a day or so
beforehand, so as to be ready for the occasion.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you, Uncle Abel; but I think Roland is the
only one whom I care to invite.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Does the liberty you have given Le include us all,
papa, dear?” inquired Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In what respect, my dear? I don’t understand you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“May each of us invite one or more very particular
friends?” Wynnette inquired.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You must consult your mother and Odalite about
that,” replied Mr. Force, good-humoredly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whom do you wish to ask, Wynnette?” inquired her
mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, only the Grandieres and the Elks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You mean the young people, of course?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, mamma, dear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let me see. There are about eight of them, all
counted—six girls and two boys. Well, my dear, you
know this wedding is to be a private one, in our own
parlor, and no company is to be specially invited to the
wedding. But you may write and ask your young
friends to come and make us a visit for a week or two, so
that they may be in the house about that time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, thank you, mamma, dear! that will be best of
all!” exclaimed Wynnette, in delight.</p>

<p class='c008'>And that same day she wrote to Oldfield and to Hill
Grove to ask the young Grandieres and Elks to come
up to Washington about the last of March to make a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>visit, mentioning that Leonidas had got home from sea,
and that he and Odalite were to be married on the first
of April, and hoping that they would come in time to
witness the wedding, which was to be a very quiet one
in their own parlor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette knew that such letters as these would insure
a visit from those to whom they were written. And
she was right. In a very few days came answers from
Oldfield and Grove Hill. All the invited accepted the
invitations, and would report in Washington on the thirtieth
of March, two days before the wedding.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let us see,” again reflected Mrs. Force. “There are
nine guests coming in all—counting six Grandieres, two
Elks and young Bayard. Of them six are young girls,
and three are young men. How shall we dispose of
them?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, mamma, dear, we must pack, like we used to do
in the country. Elva and Rosemary and myself can
sleep in one room. The four Grandiere girls can sleep
in the large double-bedded room. The two little Elks
can have the little hall chamber and sleep together. And
Roland Bayard and the Grandiere boys and Le can have
the large attic room, and sleep on cots. Never mind
where you put young men and boys, you know!” said
this little household strategist.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we must do the best we can for them,” replied
the lady, and she turned her attention to other matters—to
the details of Odalite’s simple trousseau, which was
only to consist now in a white silk wedding dress, a gray
poplin traveling dress, a navy-blue cloth suit for the voyage
across the ocean, and a few plain, home dresses and
wrappers, with plenty of underclothing.</p>

<p class='c008'>All the preparations were completed on the morning
of the thirtieth. Even Odalite’s trunk was packed, nothing
being left out but her bridal dress and traveling
suits.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just before tea on the afternoon of the thirtieth, there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>was the expected inroad of the Goths and Vandals, in
the forms of the young people from Oldfield, Grove Hill
and Forest Rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>They all traveled by the same train and arrived at the
same hour—a laughing, talking, hilarious, uproarious
troupe.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were met with a joyous and affectionate welcome.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And where is my little Rosemary? Where is my
quaint, small, young woman?” inquired Roland, when
he had shaken hands with all the rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, here she is! Here she has been all the while!”
exclaimed Wynnette, dragging the shy girl forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What! not that tall young lady? Miss Hedge, I beg
ten thousand pardons. I was looking for a little girl I
used to ride on my shoulder!” exclaimed Roland, in
affected dismay, as he took her tiny hand and raised it
to his lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, Rosemary was not tall, except in comparison to
what she had once been. Rosemary was still small and
slight—“a mere slip of a girl,” as every one called her.
She colored and cast down her eyes when her old friend
pretended to treat her as a young lady.</p>

<p class='c008'>He saw her slight distress and vexation, and immediately
changed his tune.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why!—yes!—sure enough! This is my little Rosemary,
after all!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then she looked up shyly and smiled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come! Let me show you your rooms, girls. And
you, Leonidas, convey these young men heavenward.
You young Shanghais will have to roost in the loft at
the top of the house. Beg pardon. I mean you young
gentlemen will be required to repose in the attic chambers
of the mansion. Indeed, we shall all have to be
packed like herrings in a barrel. Beg pardon, again.
I mean like guests at a hotel on Inauguration Day. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>the more the merrier, my dears,” sang Wynnette, as
she danced upstairs in advance of her party.</p>

<p class='c008'>Have you ever been in the aviary at the zoo, when all
the birds have been singing, chattering and screaming
at once?</p>

<p class='c008'>If you have, you will have some idea of the condition
of Mrs. Force’s house on this first evening of their young
guests’ arrival.</p>

<p class='c008'>They chattered in their rooms, they chattered all the
way down the stairs, and they chattered around the tea
table.</p>

<p class='c008'>The extension table in the dining room had been
drawn out to its full length to accommodate the party
of sixteen that sat down to tea.</p>

<p class='c008'>All these young people sitting opposite each other
at the long board, and under the full blaze of the chandeliers,
showed how much they had grown, changed
and improved during the three years which had elapsed
since their last meeting and parting in the country.</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite was the most beautiful of the group. She was
now nineteen years of age; her elegant form was rather
more rounded, her pure complexion brighter, her eyes
darker, and her hair richer; her voice was deeper and
sweeter; and all her motions more graceful than before.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette was seventeen; tall, thin and dark; with the
same mischievous eyes, snub nose, full, ripe lips, and
short, curly, black hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>Elva was fifteen, tall for her age, thin, fair, with
soft, blue eyes, and light, flaxen hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rosemary Hedge was also fifteen years old, but very
tiny for her age, with slender limbs and little mites of
hands and feet, a small head covered with fine, silky
black hair, a fair, clear, bright complexion, and large,
soft, tender blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The four Grandiere girls—Sophy, Nanny, Polly and
Peggy—whose ages ranged from fourteen to twenty,
were all of the same type, with well-grown and well-rounded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>forms, fair complexions, red cheeks and lips,
blue eyes, and brown hair; except for difference in age
and size, never were four sisters more alike.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two Grandiere boys, whose ages were nineteen
and twenty-two, were like the girls, with the same well-knit
forms, blooming complexions, blue eyes and brown
hair—only their features were on a larger and coarser
scale, and their faces were freckled and sunburned.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two Elk girls, Melina and Erina, were respectively
thirteen and sixteen years old, and both bore a
certain family likeness to Rosemary Hedge, except that
they were not so tiny in form or dainty and delicate in
features and complexion. They had the large blue eyes
and the fine black hair, but their faces were thin and
their complexions sallow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Perhaps the most improved of all these young people
during the preceding three years were the two gallant
young sailors, Leonidas Force and Roland Bayard, with
their tall forms, broad shoulders, deep chests, fine heads,
handsome faces and full beards—only with a difference;
for Le’s hair and beard were of a rich, silky brown,
while Roland’s, alas! were of a rough, fierce red.</p>

<p class='c008'>Upon the whole, the group of young folk around the
table was very fair.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The first of April was a perfect day. The sky was a
canopy of deepest, clearest blue. The sun shone in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>cloudless splendor. The trees in all the parks were in
full leaf or blossom. The grass was of that fresh and
tender green only to be seen at this season. The spring
flowers were all in bloom, with radiance of color and
richness of fragrance. Birds were singing rapturously
from every bush and branch.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A lovely day! Just the day for a wedding!” said
Nanny Grandiere, as she threw open the shutters of her
bedroom window, that looked out upon one of the most
beautiful parks of the city.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her three sisters, who occupied the same double-bedded
room with herself, sleeping two in a bed, jumped
up and ran across the room to join her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, a beautiful day! ‘Blessed is the bride that the
sun shines on,’ you know. Oh! I am so glad we all
came here!” said Polly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I am glad it is going to be a quiet wedding,
with only ourselves. Oh, girls! I should not have wanted
to come if they had been going to have a grand wedding,
after the manner of these fashionable city people. I
should have been scared to death among so many fine
strangers. But now it will be real jolly!” said Peggy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And Mr. Force says that as there are enough of us
we may have a dance, after the bride and groom have
gone,” chimed in Sophy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘After the bride and groom have gone!’” echoed
Nanny. “That will be ‘Hamlet’ without the <em>Prince of
Denmark</em>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, it can’t be helped. We must have the dance
without them or not at all. You know the ceremony is
to be performed at half-past seven, the refreshments
served at eight o’clock, and the bride and groom will
leave the house at nine to catch the nine-thirty train to
Baltimore, where they will stop. To-morrow morning
they go on to New York, and the day after that they
sail for Liverpool,” exclaimed Sophy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I know; but I don’t know why it should be so.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>I think they might just as well stay here and dance all
night with us, and take an early train straight through
to New York, as to start from here this evening and stop
all night in Baltimore. I think it would be kinder in
them, considering how far they are going, and how long
they will be away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it would be so fatiguing to Odalite. At least,
Mrs. Force said so. This is her plan,” Polly explained.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we had better hurry and dress. It is very
warm in this room. Think of feeling summer heat on
the first of April in a room where there is no visible
fire! Oh! this heating by steam and lighting by gas is
just wonderful!” exclaimed Sophy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I like open wood fires and astral lamps best,” said
Nanny.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! but the modern improvements are so clean and
tidy!” put in Peggy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder what our colored servants would say to
them,” mused Polly, aloud.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And even others—Miss Sibby, for instance. What
would Miss Sibby say to gas and steam?” suggested
Sophy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! I can tell you what she would say,” exclaimed
Wynnette, who suddenly entered the room, and mimicked
the old lady. “She would say: ‘Them as has the
least to do with gas and steam, sez I, comes the best
off, sez I.’ That would be her <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipse dixit</span></i>, for she don’t
believe in newfangled notions, as she calls our boasted
modern improvements.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Wynnette! Already dressed! and we not half
ready! We shall be late, I fear,” exclaimed Sophy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will that, if you don’t stir your stumps—I mean
accelerate your action,” replied frank Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, don’t wait for us. You go down to breakfast,
and don’t let them wait. I always lose my senses when
I try to dress in a hurry,” said Nanny, sitting down on
a hassock to put on her gaiters. “There! I said so! I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>have gone and put my right foot on my left boot!—I
mean, my left foot on my right boot!—I mean——I
don’t know what I mean! Please go down, and don’t
bother!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t go crazy; there’s time enough. Breakfast
won’t be ready for half an hour yet,” laughed Wynnette,
as she danced out of the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flurried girls composed themselves as well as they
could, and completed their toilets. Then they went
downstairs to the parlor.</p>

<p class='c008'>They found all the family and guests assembled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope we did not keep you waiting,” said Sophy,
the eldest sister, after the morning greeting had been
exchanged.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, papa, don’t flunk. Beg pardon. I mean, don’t
sacrifice truth to politeness. Let me reply. Yes, Miss
Grandiere, you did keep us waiting just one minute and
a half,” said Wynnette, pointing to the clock on the
mantelpiece.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Mr. Force had already given his arm to Miss
Grandiere, and was leading the way to the breakfast
room.</p>

<p class='c008'>The others followed.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a merry breakfast. Yet the two happiest ones
at the table were the most silent. Leonidas and Odalite
neither originated a joke nor laughed at the joke of any
other.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Such is selfishness of love and joy,” whispered Wynnette
to Rosemary, who was her next neighbor at the
breakfast table.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the meal was over, the young people—with the
exception of the betrothed pair, who were away somewhere
mooning by themselves—returned to the parlor,
to discuss the duties and pleasures of the day.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We must decorate the drawing room,” said Wynnette.
“No, Messrs. Grandiere and Bayard, you are not
to go to the capitol, or the departments, or to the White
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>House, or to the patent office, or to the Smithsonian, or
to the arsenal, or to the Navy Yard, or to the United
States jail, or to the National Insane Asylum—that, I
think, includes ‘the whole unbounded continent’—nor to
any other public institution; no, nor on any other sightseeing
expedition. You are just to get a Washington
directory for your guide, and you are to make the round
of all the conservatories in the city, and you are to bring
us loads and loads and loads of the very best flowers
to be had, and you are to order a marriage bell in orange
flowers, with ropes of orange flowers, and you are to order——Take
out your tablets, if you have any; if not,
tear the margin off the morning paper, and make a
memorandum, for I know the weakness of your minds
and memories. Now, then you are to order the most
æsthetic bouquet in the world for the bride, and you are
to order nine of the next most utterly utter for the
bridesmaids—for the Lord forbid that the bridesmaids’
bouquets should be equal to that of the bride!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ten bouquets! Nine bridesmaids, you say! Why, I
thought—I thought—this was to be a private wedding,”
said Roland Bayard, driving his fingers through his red
hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And so it is, my dear. We are a very small company
of family friends, and that is the very reason why
every man-jack and woman-jenny in the company must
be an officer. Like the village militia, don’t you see?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I don’t see, and I don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, then, to come down to the level of your poor
little wits, here are ten of us girls—Odalite, Wynnette,
Elva, Rosemary, Melina, Erina, Sophy, Nanny, Polly
and Peggy. Only one of us—Odalite, to wit—can be
the bride, or the captain, say, but all the rest of us mean
to be bridesmaids or officers, say!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah! And where are your rank and file?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, the outside world, who are not invited to this
entertainment. The officers must not be too familiar with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>the privates. And we are going to have an exclusive
jollification. And now I hope you understand. And
you had better be off at once, because we want all the
flowers delivered by noon. And don’t attempt to go
anywhere or do anything until you have executed this
order,” said Wynnette, in conclusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Roland Bayard and the two Grandieres walked off.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then little Elva whispered to her sister:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Wynnette, those flowers will cost from thirty to
fifty dollars. You know what awful prices mamma had
to pay for decorating her rooms every time she had a
party.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, what then?” inquired the thoughtless one.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, those poor fellows will have to pay for them,
and I don’t believe they have five dollars apiece.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!” exclaimed Wynnette. “What a scatter-brain I
am!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And she ran out without bonnet or shawl, and was
so fortunate as to catch the three young men, who had
stopped at the gate to buy a paper from a newsboy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say!” called Wynnette. “Come here, you Roland!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And he came.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I forgot to tell you. Have those flowers charged to
my father. Mr. Abel Force, you know. They will
understand. They have all supplied mamma for all her
parties. You understand?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I understand. All right,” said Roland.</p>

<p class='c008'>And Wynnette ran into the house, and Roland walked
on and joined his companions.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the deceitful, double-dealing young spendthrift
never had bud or blossom charged to his host, but paid
cash for all the flowers, thus making a deep hole in his
savings of three years.</p>

<p class='c008'>The day was spent in making the small final preparations
for the wedding.</p>

<p class='c008'>At noon the flowers came, fresh and blooming and
fragrant, because just taken from their stalks. Besides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>the bouquets, there were—according to orders—“loads
and loads and loads” of flowers to decorate the
drawing room and the supper table.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls carefully laid away the bouquets, and went
to work to decorate the rooms.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the sliding doors between the front and rear drawing
rooms they made an arch with festoons of orange
blossoms, and from the middle of the arch hung a beautiful
wedding bell of orange flowers. Under this they
meant that the marriage ceremony should be performed.
They meant to have everything their own way, or, to
tell the literal truth, Wynnette meant to have everything
her way, and to have every girl back her in that determination.</p>

<p class='c008'>The arch finished, they decorated every available part
of the room with flowers, until the place looked less like
an apartment in a dwelling house than a bower in fairyland.</p>

<p class='c008'>When their labor of love was completed the girls
joined the family at an early dinner.</p>

<p class='c008'>And when this was over they flew away to dress for
the evening.</p>

<p class='c008'>Still Wynnette had everything her own way. It was
she who had decided that the six girls from the country
should be enlisted as extra bridesmaids, “because,” she
said, “it will please them, and give them something
pleasant to talk about for a long time to come.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She had said to her mother:</p>

<p class='c008'>“They are going to be Odalite’s bridesmaids.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And Mrs. Force had not objected. It was a matter
of such little import.</p>

<p class='c008'>She had said to Odalite:</p>

<p class='c008'>“These girls have all brought their white organdie
dresses, white roses, white gloves, and the rest, to wear
to the wedding! And they want to stand up with you
and smile every time you smile, and sigh every time you
sigh, and howl every time you cry! You know! they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>want to back you in this game! I mean they wish to be
and—they are to be your supernumerary bridesmaids!”
said Wynnette, emphasizing the last clause, so there
might be no possible misunderstanding.</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite was so happy that in answer to this she only
quoted from Edmund Lear’s delicious “Book of Nonsense”:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>“I don’t care,</div>
      <div class='line'>All the birds in the air</div>
      <div class='line'>Are welcome to roost in my bonnet.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>And so it was settled that there were to be one groomsman
and nine bridesmaids. A most unheard-of arrangement;
but as Wynnette emphatically declared—there
was no law against it.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now the girls were off to their rooms to dress
for the occasion.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <span class='large'>“A QUIET WEDDING”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>At seven o’clock they were all assembled in Mrs.
Force’s room, waiting for the summons to go down.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were all dressed with the simple elegance that
became the occasion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite wore a white silk-trained dress, with a lace
overdress looped with lilies of the valley, and a lace veil
fastened to her hair by a spray of the same delicate
flower. She wore no jewelry. It was a whim of the
bride to wear nothing on this occasion that she had worn
on that of her first broken bridal—not even the same
sort of materials for her dress, or the same sort of
flowers for ornaments. Her bridal was very plain and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>inexpensive. But no flowers could have bloomed more
beautifully than her cheeks and lips, and no diamonds
shone more brilliantly than her eyes. The light of happiness
irradiated her face and form—her whole presence and atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c008'>The nine bridesmaids were all dressed very nearly
alike.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette, Elva and Rosemary had white tulle dresses
trimmed with rose-colored ribbon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sophy, Nanny, Polly and Peggy Grandiere wore
white organdie dresses trimmed with light blue ribbon;
and Erny and Milly Elk, white swiss muslin suits
trimmed with bright yellow ribbon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Force wore a pale mauve damasse silk.</p>

<p class='c008'>No one except the young bride wore any headdress
but their own tastefully arranged hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was to be a quiet wedding, you know—a very quiet
wedding, with none but the family friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>There came a rap at the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette, who was nearest at hand, opened it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell your mother, my dear, that the Rev. Dr.
Priestly has come,” said Mr. Force, who stood without.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Mrs. Force had heard the voice, and answered for
herself:</p>

<p class='c008'>“We are ready and waiting. Come in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He entered, smiling on the bevy of beauties that met
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>He singled out his daughter, kissed her on the forehead,
and drew her arm in his to take her downstairs,
mentally applying to her the pretty line of Tennyson:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Queen rose of the rosebud garden of girls.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>He led her down and the others followed in pairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>He led her into the parlor, where stood the portly
form of the Rev. Dr. Priestly, in full canonicals, and
surrounded by a small group of four young men—to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>wit: Leonidas Force, the bridegroom; Roland Bayard,
his best man; and Messrs. Ned and Sam Grandiere,
nothing in particular.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bridegroom advanced, bowed and received the
bride from her father’s hand and led her up before the
minister, who now stood under the floral arch between
the front and rear drawing rooms, and from which the
floral wedding bell hung.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bridegroom and the bride stood before the minister—Roland
Bayard, best man, stood on his right; Wynnette,
first bridesmaid, stood on her left; behind them
the eight white-robed girls formed a semicircle. Mr.
Force stood on their right, with Mrs. Force on his arm.
She was pale and trembling. He perceived her state,
and whispered:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose every mother suffers something in seeing
her daughter married, even under the most auspicious
circumstances! But look at Odalite and Le! See how
happy those children are, and recover your spirits.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She glanced up in her husband’s kind face and smiled.</p>

<p class='c008'>The doorbell rang sharply. Perhaps it was the utter
stillness of the house—in the solemn pause of expectancy,
as the minister opened his book—which made that
sound reverberate through the air like a sudden and
peremptory summons.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Force looked up anxiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is of no consequence, my dear. Some chance
caller, who does not know what is going on here. But I
prepared for such an event by giving orders to the hall
boy not to admit any one, but to tell all and sundry who
might come that we are engaged,” whispered Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush!” she murmured, but she looked relieved.
“Hush! Dr. Priestly is about to begin.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The minister, in fact, began, in a very impressive
manner, to read the opening exhortation, and every eye
was fixed upon him and every ear bent to hear him.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was some movement in the hall outside. Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Force started and turned her head. Her husband
stooped and murmured low:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t tremble so, my dear! It is only the servants
pressing close to the door to steal a look at the wedding.
They would not let any visitors in. And even if they
should make such a mistake, it would be no great matter!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush!” she answered, in the lowest murmur. “Do
not talk! Attend to the ceremony.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uninterrupted by the inaudible whisper between husband
and wife, the ceremony was proceeding. And no
one moved or spoke, until the minister, lifting his eyes
from the book in his hands, inquired gravely:</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Who giveth this woman to be married to this
man?’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘I do,’” answered Abel Force, stepping forward,
taking his daughter’s hand with tender solemnity and
placing it in that of Leonidas, who bowed with deep reverence
as he received it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Abel Force retreated to the side of his pale and
agitated wife, whispered with a smile:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just what your father did for me, my love! Just
what Leonidas may have to do for Odalite’s daughters
some twenty years hence! The order of nature, dear
wife! And we must smile and not cry over it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Elfrida Force was not grieving over the marriage
of her daughter. There was nothing in that marriage to
give her pain; everything to give her satisfaction. Odalite
was marrying no stranger, but Leonidas, who had
been brought up in her home, who loved her, and was
beloved by her as an only son. And Odalite was not to
be taken away from her, but was to live on the adjoining
plantation to their own, where, if they pleased, mother
and daughter might meet every day. Altogether a most
perfectly satisfactory marriage, in which her soul would
have delighted but for a nameless dread of approaching
evil—a dread which she could neither comprehend nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>conquer—a dread of impeding ill which was fast growing
into terror of an immediate death blow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!” she breathed. “When it is entirely over—‘finished,
done and sealed’—and they are off at sea, then,
and then only, shall I be able to breathe freely.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Meanwhile the solemn rites went on to the conclusion,
and once more Odalite, with her hand safely clasped in
that of her bridegroom, heard spoken over them the
awful warning: “Those whom God hath joined together,
let not man put asunder.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a pause, but no interruption on this occasion—a
short pause, and then the solemn, pathetic, beautiful
benediction was pronounced upon the newly married
and indeed happy pair.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then Leonidas took his bride by her hand, to
give her the sacred, sealing kiss, when—before his lips
could meet hers—he was suddenly seized from behind
and violently hurled to the other end of the room.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The intruder was Col. Angus Anglesea, who caught
Odalite to his breast, and with his arm firmly clasping
her waist, stood, haughty, insolent and defiant, in the
midst of the thunderstruck group.</p>

<p class='c008'>A scene of indescribable confusion followed. The
bride fainted, the bridesmaids shrieked, the old minister
dropped his book, and fell back in the nearest chair, in
a state bordering on apoplexy.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>The men, panic-stricken by amazement for a moment,
now pressed forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anglesea glared at them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This woman is my wife!” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le instantly recovered himself, and dashed madly forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>Heaven only knows what he might have done, but he
was intercepted, and held as in a vise by Mr. Force,
who sternly said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Le, there must be no violence here. This madman
must be dealt with by law, not by violence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘This madman!’” shouted the infuriated youth,
struggling desperately to free himself. “‘This madman,’
is it? This scoundrel, steeped to the lips in vice
and crime! This——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Le, be quiet! Would you murder, or be murdered?”
demanded Mr. Force, holding the young maniac firmly.
Then turning to the intruder, he said, in a calm, commanding
tone: “Col. Anglesea, leave the house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“When I have accomplished that for which I came
here,” answered the intruder, smiling superior.</p>

<p class='c008'>Young Bayard made a dash at him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Roland!” exclaimed Mr. Force, in a peremptory
tone that arrested the steps of the young man. “Stop!
I will have no struggle in my house. If the man does
not leave quietly, he shall be taken off by a policeman.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But now all Abel Force’s attention and energy were
required to control the young lion whom he held.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let me get at him! The thief, who married a rich
widow only to rob and desert her! The bigamist, who,
having a living wife, tried to deceive and marry a
wealthy, betrothed maiden, only to rob and ruin her!
The forger, who invented and published a false account
of his own death that he might entrap his victim into
another marriage, and take a mean revenge by coming
here with pretended claims to stop it! Oh! but he shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>die for this!” roared the youth, foaming with rage and
struggling fiercely to free himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Le! Le! be quiet, I say! You are stark, staring
mad!” exclaimed Abel Force, holding the young man
fast, though it took all his strength to do it.</p>

<p class='c008'>He might as well have talked to a cyclone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This felon!” thundered the youth—“this felon, who
has broken every law of God and man! This felon, I
say, who should have been in the State prison twenty
years ago, serving out a life term! And you see him
with my wife in his arms, and you will not let me go!
Oh!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Here Mrs. Force, commanding herself by a great effort,
went up to where Col. Anglesea stood holding Odalite
to his bosom, and clasped her hands, raised her eyes
to him, and pleaded:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! for dear mercy’s sake, give me my poor child!
Don’t you see that she is fainting, dying?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Somewhat to her surprise, Anglesea placed Odalite
in her arms, saying, lightly:</p>

<p class='c008'>“So that you do not take her out of the room! You
know that she is my wife! And——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Edward Grandiere! Be kind enough to step and
bring in a policeman—two of them, if possible,” said
Mr. Force, who had all he could do to hold Leonidas.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle! uncle! I don’t want to hurt you, but, by my
soul, if you don’t let me go, I shall be compelled to hurt
you!” exclaimed the maddened and writhing youth.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the strong, mature man held him in arms that
were like iron cable chains.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I tell you I shall hurt you, uncle!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well, Le! Hurt me! But I shall hold you all
the same.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why won’t you let me kill him?” yelled Le.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because, though he deserves death, you would commit
a crime.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Heaven! must I bear this?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“Be patient, Le! Let the law deal with this man!
Edward Grandiere, I asked you to go for a policeman!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir! I only stopped to ask Roland where I
should find one,” said the young countryman, apologetically,
as he hurried away.</p>

<p class='c008'>At this point Mrs. Force had led Odalite to an easy-chair,
where she recovered from her fainting fit only to
fall into a paroxysm of hysterical sobs and tears. Her
heartbroken mother sat by her side. Her bridesmaids
stood all around her, too much frightened to offer the
least comfort or assistance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Col. Anglesea approached this group.</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite, who was sobbing convulsively, shuddered,
and covered her eyes with her hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bridesmaids, who all knew him, for he had dined
often at the tables of their parents, regarded him in
fear and horror, and cast down their eyes to avoid looking
at him.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Angus Anglesea ignored them all, passed them,
and, addressing Mrs. Force, said, almost apologetically:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did not wish or intend to make a scene. But it
was more than even my self-possession could endure to
see my wife in the arms of another man, who was about
to kiss her. I only want my just and lawful rights.
You, madam, know that your eldest daughter is my lawful
wife. Knowing this, I would ask you why you permitted
your daughter to commit a felony that exposes
her to the penalty of the laws for such cases made and
provided?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We thought that Odalite was free to marry. We
thought that you were dead,” said Elfrida Force, who
had suddenly grown superstitiously afraid of this man,
who seemed to be a Satan in strength, subtlety and unscrupulous
wickedness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You thought I was dead! Upon what ground? I
am in the prime of life, and in the height of health.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“We saw the notice of your death in a paper sent
to us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Really? Well, that is rather startling. I should
like to see that paper.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At this moment Dr. Priestly came up, and said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is all very terrible. I—I do not understand it
in the least.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is easily explained, sir. A false report of my
death reached my wife there. She, believing herself to
be a widow, contracted marriage with that young gentleman
yonder, who seems to be executing a war dance in
the arms of my father-in-law!” replied Col. Anglesea.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Dr. Priestly! will you be so kind as to go and
assist Mr. Force in bringing Leonidas to reason?”
pleaded the lady.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ye-yes! Of course! Oh, this is terrible, terrible!
In the whole course of my ministry I never met anything
so terrible. But, sir,” he said, suddenly breaking
off in his discourse and turning to Col. Anglesea, “you
said that this young lady believed herself to be a widow
when she contracted marriage with Mr. Force. But she
was never known here as wife or widow. I have known
her for more than three years as Miss Force.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That certainly requires explanation, as our marriage
was not a secret one, but was solemnized in the face of
day and before a large congregation——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And then knocked as high as the sky by the dropping
down upon you of your Californian wife! Oh,
you hoofed and horned devil!” said Wynnette, suddenly
joining the group and unable longer to restrain herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Rev. Dr. Priestly stared.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! what am I saying? I mean, reverend sir”—Wynnette
began, apologetically—“I mean that this gentleman’s
attempted marriage with my elder sister was
arrested at the very altar by the appearance of a lady
from St. Sebastian, who claimed to be, and proved herself
to be, his lawful wife.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>The old minister looked perplexed and helplessly from
the earnest girl to the scornful man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“After that my sister went from the church to my
father’s house, and lived under our parents’ protection.
Of course, she was still Miss Force. The unfinished
ceremony could not have changed her name or condition,
even if the Californian had been an impostor, which she
was not. This cowardly dead beat and mean skala——Oh!
I beg pardon, I am sure, Dr. Priestly. I should
have said: Col. Anglesea, here present, knows that she
was not an impostor, and he knows that he has no claim
on Odalite. He only comes here to make a scene. His
marriage was broken off at the altar by the appearance
of his wife, and he is determined that Odalite’s shall be
broken off, for the day at least, by the appearance of
himself, with the claim that he is her husband. It is
‘tit for tat,’ you know. ‘What’s good for the gander is
good for the goose,’ you see. Oh, dear! Excuse me!
I mean it is his revenge, reprisal, commending back of
the poisoned chalice, don’t you know?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Madam, is this true?” inquired the bewildered minister.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Force did not reply. She dared not. She was
so utterly subdued by the appearance of her archenemy,
under such inexplicable circumstances, she could only
ignore his question and repeat her request:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! Dr. Priestly, you are a man of peace. Pray go
and help my husband to bring our young relative to
reason.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The old minister unwillingly trotted off and arrived on
the scene of action in good time, for Mr. Force’s strength
was beginning to give way under the struggles of his
prisoner to escape without hurting his captor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You see that man standing among the ladies, whom
his presence insults and contaminates, and you will not
let me get at him!” cried Le.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear boy, I will not have a fight in my parlor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>and in the presence of women and children, do you understand?
Wait for the police. We will have him
peaceably arrested and taken off. Then our interruption
will be over. The marriage ceremony was concluded,
you know. As soon as we get rid of this madman—for
of course he is a madman—you can get ready
and take the train for Baltimore, just as if nothing unpleasant
had happened.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force spoke in a clear and ringing voice, and
was heard by Col. Anglesea, who laughed out aloud and
derisively.</p>

<p class='c008'>At that moment Roland Bayard and Grandiere came
in, convoying two policemen.</p>

<p class='c008'>So rapidly had the events occurred which take so long
to report, that ten minutes had not elapsed since the first
appearance of Col. Anglesea on the scene, nor three
since the departure of the young men in search of the
policemen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah! here you are!” exclaimed Abel Force, in a tone
of relief.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir!” said Roland Bayard. “We were so fortunate
as to meet the two officers at the corner of the
street!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And strangely enough, they were on their way to the
house,” added Ned Grandiere.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some of the servants must have had the discretion to
go for them. Well, officers, I am glad that you are here,
and I hope you will be able to do your unpleasant duty
quietly,” said Mr. Force. And pointing directly to the
intruder, he added: “I give that man, there, Angus
Anglesea, in charge for a violent breach of the peace.
Take him away at once.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The policemen stared at the speaker, and then at Col.
Anglesea, in a very unofficial sort of way, and finally
walked up to the colonel, and one of them said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t understand it, sir! What does it mean?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“He’s drunk, I guess! But that need not hinder your
duty. Go and serve the papers on him at once.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The policeman came back to Mr. Force and offered
him a folded document.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is this? What nonsense is this?” inquired
Mr. Force, without taking the paper, because both his
hands were still engaged in holding Le.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take it and read it, sir, if you please,” said the officer
who had served it. “It is addressed to yourself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Roland,” said Mr. Force, addressing young Bayard,
“I don’t want to get you into a fight with your brother-in-arms,
by asking you to hold Le; but will you please
open that paper and hold it up before my eyes that I
may read it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Roland bowed in silence, took the paper, opened it
and stared at it for a moment, before he held it up to his
host to be read.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Abel Force began to peruse the document and
frowned as he went on. And well he might!</p>

<p class='c008'>For it was no less than a writ of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas corpus</span></i>, issued
by a judge of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia,
ordering Abel Force to produce the body of Odalite
Anglesea, otherwise Odalite Force, before him the
next morning, April 2, at 10 o’clock.</p>

<p class='c008'>Abel Force, as has been seen, was a law-abiding man.
On this trying occasion, under this galling insult, he
commanded himself with wonderful power.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well,” he said. “You have done your duty. I
will obey the order. Take that man away with you. He
has committed a gross breach of the peace; but let that
pass for the present.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>At this moment Col. Anglesea came up and said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will meet you before the judge to-morrow morning.
For the present, having seen the writ of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas
corpus</span></i> served upon you, I withdraw. Good-evening, sir.
Ladies, good-evening.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And with as courtly a bow as if he were leaving the
drawing room of a duchess, Col. Anglesea went out, followed
by the policemen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now be still, Le! This shall be settled equitably to-morrow.
For the present nothing more can be done,”
said Mr. Force, as with a long breath of relief he at
length released his prisoner.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Le was no sooner free than he dashed out of the
room and out of the house in pursuit of his enemy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let him go!” said Abel Force, in desperation. “Let
him go. But I do not think he will catch Anglesea. He
has probably taken a carriage, for I heard wheels roll
away from the door before I released Le.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sir, can I be of any further service here?” inquired
the aged minister, coming forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, reverend sir, you cannot; but you will perhaps
take some refreshments before you leave,” replied Mr.
Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not any, I thank you. This has been a most agitating
evening. If I can serve you in any manner, at
this trying crisis, pray command me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We thank you very much.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If my presence to-morrow can avail in any way——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do not think it can, yet I should be glad to have
you come.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will meet you,” said the rector. And after shaking
hands all around he left the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force stepped quickly over to where his wife sat
by his daughter’s easy-chair, holding her hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite’s violent paroxysm of distress was over, but
she still sobbed with a low, gasping breath as she lay
back in a state of exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>He looked at the girl and sighed. He would have
spoken to her, but his wife raised her hand in warning
and said, in a low tone:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Leave her alone for a little while. She is very much
prostrated, but will rally presently.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Elfrida,” he said then, bending over the lady’s chair,
“Elfrida! can there be any truth in that man’s pretended
claim to our child? Not that it will make any
difference in the end, for I swear by all that is sacred,
he shall never possess her! But you remember when we
read that sketch of his life in the Angleton <cite>Advertiser</cite>,
we noticed that the date of the death of his first wife,
as given there, was some weeks later than the date of his
marriage with the California widow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I remember,” said the lady, faintly, for her heart,
her mother heart, seemed dying within her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And such being the case, we should be thankful that
Odalite’s marriage with Le was stopped just where it
was. It would have been most disastrous if the man
had reappeared and set up his claim to Odalite weeks or
months after the marriage had been consummated.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Indeed it would!” replied the lady. “And yet, Abel,
it may all be a fraud. He may have no claim on her
whatever. If he could contrive to have published a
false obituary of himself, could he not even more easily
have inserted in the sketch of his life attached to it a
false date of the death of his wife?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Indeed he could. The whole question of his right to
Odalite hangs upon the true date of Lady Mary Anglesea’s
demise. If she died before his Californian marriage,
then is the Californian woman his lawful wife,
and Odalite is free. If, on the contrary, as is made to
appear in that fraudulent obituary notice, Lady Mary
Anglesea died since the marriage with the Californian,
then was that second marriage a felony, laying him
liable to prosecution for bigamy, and to imprisonment at
hard labor in the State’s prison, and his third incomplete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>marriage ceremony with our daughter only an
awkward entanglement, which affords him a false excuse
to lay claim to her, and which it may require the
wisdom of the law courts to unravel. I have no doubt
as to the final issue. We must be prepared to meet the
villain in court to-morrow. We must prove the arrest
of the marriage ceremony at All Faith Church, three
years ago, by the appearance of the would-be bridegroom’s
wife. Fortunately we have ‘a cloud of witnesses’
to that fact. Besides ourselves, all the young
people who are our guests were present at the church
on that occasion. Cheer up, my love!” he said, going
over to the other side of Odalite’s chair, and bending
over her. “Your perfect freedom and happiness is but
a question of time. And meanwhile you will remain
under my protection.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dear papa! I cause you much trouble, do I not?”
she inquired, tenderly, putting her hand in his.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, dearest! You never caused me any trouble in
all your life! A scoundrel has given us both trouble;
but it cannot last long. If the hearing should not be
decisive to-morrow, I must ask for time and get the
California lady up here. Also, later, that will take
more time, I must send a trusty messenger over to England
to ascertain from parish registers and tombstones
the exact date of the death of Lady Mary Anglesea. But
through all, as you are a minor, you must and shall remain
under my protection. Take courage, love!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There is Le!” exclaimed Mrs. Force, as the hall
doorbell rang, and the door opened, and a hurried step
was heard approaching the drawing room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force started up, and went to meet the midshipman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I could not find the poltroon! He has run away,
as he did on that first occasion, when I sent Roland to
him!” exclaimed the youth. “But yet he shall not
escape me!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“Come here, Le,” said Odalite, in a gentle voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>And the boy crossed the room and knelt before her,
placing both his hands in hers.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the old, instinctive, knightly gesture of allegiance
and loyalty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it, Odalite?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c008'>She bent and kissed his forehead, and then she said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“My lover and husband, you would do anything for
me to-night? Would you not?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Anything, Odalite! my love and queen! anything!
I would live or die for you! I would forego the dearest
wish of my heart for you!” he exclaimed, lifting her
hands and pressing them to his lips, and then placing
them on his head—another old knightly gesture of allegiance
and loyalty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Kiss me, Le! Kiss me with the kiss that seals our
marriage vows,” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>He started up, and caught her to his bosom, and kissed
her fondly, fervently, reverentially.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, Le, I wish you to promise me to forego vengeance
on your ‘dearest foe.’ To use no violence toward
the wicked man who has caused all our trouble;
because, dearest dear, there can be no violence without
lawbreaking, and no lawbreaking without such consequences
as would inflict the deepest sorrow, the fiercest
anguish on me. And I have already suffered so much,
you would not have me suffer more. You will promise
me, Le?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, my best beloved! Yes, my sovereign lady! I
will promise all you ask—even to the renouncing of my
just vengeance and the leaving of that incarnate fiend
to the law. I wish it could hang him! I hope, at the
least, it will send him to the State prison! I will do all
that my queen——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your wife, Le.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My angel wife requires me to do. And I will endure
all that she requires me to endure.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>“Meantime—although we must have patience until
this case is decided, as it must be decided, in our favor—we
are husband and wife. Never dream that I can
consider myself in any other light than as your wife, or
that I could think of you in any other way than as my
husband. We shall not be separated, but remain, as
lately, members of the same family, inmates of the same
house; living as a betrothed couple, or as brother and
sister, until this cloud from the depths of Tartarus has
been cleared away from between us. Do you promise,
Le?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Everything! Everything you wish, Odalite.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is my dear, brave, loyal Le!”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was something in this interview—that had been
held in the sight and hearing of all the little company—that
so touched all hearts that the boys and girls gathered
around the young couple with looks of heartfelt
sympathy. The girls kissed Odalite and pressed the
hands of Le. The boys shook hands with Le, and looked
“unutterable things” at Odalite.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear,” said Mr. Force to his wife, “I think you
had better take our daughter off to your own apartment.
It grows late, and she is tired. And we have a trying
day before us to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This was the signal for the dispersion of the little
group. And they all bade good-night and retired.</p>

<p class='c008'>So ended Odalite’s second wedding day.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <span class='large'>THE NEXT MORNING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was a drizzling, chilly, cheerless day—one of those
relapses into winter into which early spring sometimes
falls.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Not one of the family had been able to sleep well after
such a harassing evening as they had passed.</p>

<p class='c008'>They assembled around the breakfast table with pale
faces and careworn looks.</p>

<p class='c008'>The table was full, and even crowded, with family
and guests—sixteen in all.</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite was the last to come in. Her face was deathly
white, and showed signs of an anxious and sleepless
night. Yet she greeted the whole party with a wan
smile and a slight bow as she took her seat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not one word was said of the ordeal soon to be passed
through. Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Force would allude to
it, and no one else durst.</p>

<p class='c008'>The conversation went on, or, rather, failed to go on,
in abortive jets.</p>

<p class='c008'>Subjects were started, but fell.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some one said it was a horrid day, so different from
yesterday, and more like November than April.</p>

<p class='c008'>And several others said yes, or some word to the same
effect, and that subject dropped dead.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some one mentioned that the “English Opera Troupe”
would perform the “Bride of Lammermoor” that evening.</p>

<p class='c008'>No one answered that venture except Mr. Force, who,
as a mere matter of form and politeness, said he believed
so.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ned Grandiere said it was good growing weather for
the crops.</p>

<p class='c008'>But no one complimented him by a reply.</p>

<p class='c008'>And at length the dull repast was over, and all arose
from the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was now nine o’clock, and raining hard. At ten
Mr. Force and Odalite were required to arrive before
the judge.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the party left the breakfast room, the guests dispersed
to parlor, library, or chambers, as their inclinations
led them.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Mrs. Force called Odalite, and went upstairs, followed
by all her daughters, to prepare for her drive to
the courthouse.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le followed his uncle into a little smoking room at
the back of the hall. Neither of the men went there to
smoke. Mr. Force went there to be alone while he
waited for his wife and daughter, and Le to speak to his
uncle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle Abel, can I have a word with you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“As many as you please, or as time will permit, my
boy. Come in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They entered the room, and took seats at the little
round table, on which stood pipes of every description,
cigar cases, tobacco pots, tapers, ash saucers and all the
paraphernalia of smoking.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle Abel,” inquired Le, as soon as they were
seated, “have you secured counsel?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, Le, nor shall I do so. To engage counsel would
be to give the case more importance than I choose to
give it. It is a simple <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas corpus</span></i>. A very informal
matter, and, in this instance, a very impertinent one—an
abuse of the privilege of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas corpus</span></i>. I do not
need counsel, and shall not have any. I shall tell my
story to the judge. I do not even know that I shall call
a witness. That is all that will be necessary. I have no
fears of the result.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle Abel, I must go with you before the judge
this morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, Le!” emphatically objected Mr. Force. “No,
Le! I cannot have my daughter, my young and innocent
child, exposed to the ignominy of standing between
two men, each of whom claims her as his wife.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The young man was shocked at the presentation of
the case from a point of view he had never contemplated
before, and too greatly confused for a moment to make
any reply. At length he said:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>“But, Uncle Abel, we know who has the right to her!
We know that she is my wife!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, Le, we do not know that. We only think we
know it. We thought we knew that Angus Anglesea was
dead and in Hades. But you see he is alive, and in
Washington.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is a nuisance; but his being here gives him no
claim on Odalite.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“None as you and I think. But we do not know what
the law may decide, Le. It is of no use going over the
whole situation again. You know it, as well as I do.
Angus Anglesea married Ann Maria Wright, August 1,
18—. Of that transaction we have abundant proof. If
Anglesea were then free to contract that marriage, then
is he the lawful husband of Ann Maria Anglesea, his
second wife. But, on the other hand, if his first wife,
Lady Mary Anglesea, did not die until the twenty-fifth
of that same August, then his marriage with Ann Maria
Wright, on the first of the said month, is null and void,
and he was free to contract marriage at the time that he
married my daughter, and Odalite Force is his legal second
wife.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Heaven! oh, Heaven! oh, Heaven! What shall
I do?” exclaimed the youth, starting up in a frenzy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘We must be wise as serpents and harmless as
doves,’” said Mr. Force; “for, Le, we have to deal with
one who has the malice and subtlety of a demon from
the deepest abyss. He is absolutely unscrupulous. I
do not know, mind you, but I firmly believe he has falsified
dates to suit his own base purposes. I believe also
that he designedly laid a trap for us by which he could
satiate his vengeance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—I shall kill him, and hang for it!” burst forth the
boy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, you won’t, Le. You came of Christian parents,
and have had a Christian training. You will do nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>unworthy of your race and education,” calmly replied
Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle!” exclaimed the youth, “how came that false
publication of his death, with time, place and circumstances
all complete, in the newspaper of his own village?
It is amazing. It is incredible that such a fraud
could have been perpetrated.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, it is amazing and incredible. And yet we know
that it is a fraud, since the man is alive and well. How
it was done I do not know. Why it was done I can well
understand. It was done as a trap to catch us, and place
us in a false and humiliating position. I have no doubt
that, from the hour of his ejection from our house and
his ignominious retreat from the neighborhood, he meditated
vengeance. I have no doubt he lay in wait, watching
us for these three years past, giving no sign of his
existence, leaving us to suppose that we were finally rid
of him, but all the while watching and waiting for your
return, Le, to see what would come of it. I believe that
he knew the course of your ship as well as you did yourself—knew
where she went and when she was ordered
home. Then he manufactured this false evidence of his
death, with time, place and circumstances all complete,
as you said, with obituary eulogy, sketch of his life and
career, and including his marriage with Lady Mary
Merland, the date of her death, August 25, 18—, and
his second marriage with Odalite Force——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—I—uncle, I am quite anxious to hang for that
man!” panted the youth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But we are not willing to let you, Le. Your execution
would be of no sort of comfort to Odalite, or any
of us. Now let me go on. All these concocted and published
falsehoods had but one end—to entrap us all into
a false sense of security, and to allow you and Odalite
to contract marriage on your return from sea. I have
no doubt that within ten days after your ship sailed from
Rio de Janeiro, homeward bound, he sailed from Liverpool
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>to New York, under an assumed name, and that he
has been in the country ever since, and lately in the
city, watching for your wedding day, so that he might
turn the tables, and snatch your bride from your possession
at the very altar, as it were, and so humiliate us
all in retaliation for his exposure at All Faith Church.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, the demon! the demon! Any fate would be
cheaply bought at the cost of sending him to——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Le! Le! control yourself! Remember your Christian
parentage and training, and do not speak and act
like any border ruffian. Remember also that we do not
know the man has falsified the date of his wife’s death.
We only think so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle, suppose the judge to-day should decide
against us—should adjudge Odalite to be the wife of
that devil, and give her to him—what then?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do not for a moment anticipate any such decision,”
said Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yet, it is possible,” muttered Le.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But most improbable. The case, I think, from every
point of view, is too clearly in our favor.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You think, but you do not know. Our thoughts have
misled us up to this moment, and may be misleading
us now. But admitting the possibility that the decision
may be against us—that Odalite may be given into the
custody of Anglesea——”</p>

<p class='c008'>The father’s face darkened and flushed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I would not give my child up to the scoundrel!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But suppose the court were to order you to do so?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I would resist, and take the consequences. I would
never give my child to that devil! I would sooner—Heaven
knows that I would sooner throw her alive into
that lion’s cage in the circus at the Smithsonian Park
over there!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, uncle, suppose, in case of your resistance, the
officers were ordered to do their duty and take the
woman from you by force, to give her to the man. You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>know such might be the effect of your resistance. What
then?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The father’s face darkened like a thundercloud. His
eyes, under their black brows, flashed like lightning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Le,” he said, “why do you torture me by such improbable
suppositions? In such a case I should—I
could be another Virginius, and give my child instant
death to save her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, uncle, you would not. You came of Christian
parents, and you have had a Christian training. You
would do nothing unworthy of your race and your education.
Uncle, remember your Christian parentage and
training, and do not speak and act like a heathen Roman,”
said Le, solemnly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two men looked at each other in comic embarrassment
almost approaching laughter, had not the matter
been so serious.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We have been letting imagination run away with
us, Le. You and I have been getting ourselves into unnecessary
heroics. There will be nothing to justify it.
It is true that we have the most infernal villain to deal
with that ever disgraced the human form, but he must
be dealt with by law, and not by violence. All will be
well,” said the elder man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle, it was I who got into heroics first, and then
stung you into the same state. But really now, I do not
think that I shall have any occasion to murder Anglesea
and swing for it, or that you will have any cause to
enact the Roman father and slay your daughter to save
her. Wait for my <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I had been that same Roman father, it would not
have been my own kid I’d have killed, you bet. It would
have been t’other I’d have gone for. I mean, I never
could see the sense of Virginius slaying his own daughter,
and running amuck through the streets of Rome, instead
of doing execution on the minion of Appius Claudius
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>in the first place. It was wrong end foremost, like
most of the heroic dodges.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Of course it was Wynnette who spoke. She was
standing within the open door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you want, my dear?” inquired her father.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mamma sent me to look for you, and tell you that it
is half-past nine. She and Odalite are ready, and the
carriage is at the door.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you, dear. Tell mamma that I will be with
her in a moment,” said Mr. Force, as he arose from his
seat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette ran off with her message.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So, uncle, you will not allow me to go with you to
the examination?” inquired Le.</p>

<p class='c008'>“By no means! On no account, dear boy! You yourself
should not wish it under the circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right. Who is going with Odalite besides yourself?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Her mother, her two sisters, Rosemary Hedge, and
the four Misses Grandiere.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They can’t all go in one carriage.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No; no one but Odalite, her mother and the eldest
Miss Grandiere will go in our carriage; the others will
go by the street cars, under the escort of Roland Bayard.
I take a crowd of ladies with me not only as witnesses
to the broken marriage at All Faith Church—for the
young men could have answered that purpose—but as
the most fitting, proper and delicate support to my
daughter. I take only one man, Roland Bayard, not
only as the most important witness, who brought Anglesea’s
Californian wife from San Francisco to St. Mary’s,
but also as a proper escort for the young ladies in the
street car. But you, Le, should, in delicacy, absent
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“At least, I will not press my company on you, uncle.
But perhaps I may be there later. Don’t let anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>discourage you, no matter how the case seems to be
going. Wait for my <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</span></i>,” said Le.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force was drawing on his light overcoat in the
hall, to which they had walked during this conversation,
and he scarcely heard or heeded the youth’s last words,
which seemed to be so significant.</p>

<p class='c008'>They met Mrs. Force and Odalite at the front door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The girls have gone on in the cars before. Roland is
with them. I told them to wait in the vestibule of the
City Hall until we should join them,” said the elder
lady.</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite said nothing. She was white and still, as she
had been at the breakfast table.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was pouring rain.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the front door was opened Mr. Force and Leonidas
both took large umbrellas from the hall rack and
held them over the heads of the two ladies as they passed
from the house to the carriage.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the two latter had entered and taken their seats,
Mr. Force followed them, and Le closed the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall bring her back with me,” said the elder man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am sure that you will,” replied the younger.</p>

<p class='c008'>The carriage drove off, and Le re-entered the house,
muttering to himself:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let them wait for my <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</span></i>!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <span class='large'>BEFORE THE JUDGE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force with his party drove directly to the City
Hall.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was still raining hard, when they arrived—so hard
that when the carriage drew up before the broad flight
of steps leading up to the main entrance of the building,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Mr. Force, upon alighting upon the pavement, had to
take out one lady at a time, and lead her under the shelter
of a large umbrella up into the hall.</p>

<p class='c008'>They found Wynnette, Elva and Rosemary, with the
three younger Grandiere girls, all under the escort of
Roland Bayard, waiting for them in the vestibule.</p>

<p class='c008'>When all the party were assembled, they mustered
quite a formidable company—eleven in number.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never was in a courthouse in all my life before!
I feel just as if I was going to be tried for murder or
larceny, or something, myself! I know I shall never be
able to hold up my head again!” whispered Elva, in a
frightened voice, to Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I reckon I shall be tried for murder, if ever I
get a good chance to let daylight through that foreign
beat!” replied Wynnette, too mad to mend her phrases
as she usually did.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t be distressed, Elva, dear! We are not going
into court. This is a case to be heard in chambers,”
Roland explained.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Chambers!” echoed, in a breath, all the girls, whose
only idea of chambers was bedrooms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before Roland could explain further, Mr. Force had
come in with Odalite on his arm, and hurried the whole
party up another flight of stairs and along another passage,
until they reached a door at which a bailiff stood.</p>

<p class='c008'>The latter opened the door, in silence.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole party entered a large and well-furnished
room, where, on this cold and rainy second of April, a
bright coal fire was burning in the grate. The floor was
covered with a dark red carpet, the windows shaded with
buff blinds, now drawn three-quarters up, because the
day was dark, and the walls were lined with tall bookcases,
filled with well-worn volumes, mostly bound in
calf. Several library tables, loaded with folios and stationery,
occupied the middle of the spacious apartment.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a large leathern chair, at one of these tables, sat a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>venerable man, with white hair and a benign countenance,
a judge of the Supreme Court of the District of
Columbia, whom, for convenience, we will call Judge
Blank.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a grave young man standing near him,
who might have been clerk or private secretary.</p>

<p class='c008'>And seated in another armchair, at some little distance,
was Col. Anglesea, looking as careless as if he
were making a morning call.</p>

<p class='c008'>He, too, seemed to be without counsel or witnesses.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force came forward with his party, bowed to the
dignitary, whom he frequently met in social life and
knew very well, and saluted him with a—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-morning, judge,” as if he, too, had just
dropped in to make a morning call.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-morning, Mr. Force,” replied his honor, rising
and looking about him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Seeing the large party who had entered the room, he
turned to the young man in attendance, and said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“O’Brien, find seats for these ladies.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When they were all seated, Mr. Force remained standing
before the judge, with only the table between them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Col. Anglesea sat back at ease in his chair, with his
chin a little elevated, playing carelessly with the charms
attached to his watch chain.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a short pause, and then Mr. Force, laying
a document on the table, said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your honor, I return the writ with which I have
been served. My daughter, Odalite Force, is present.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take a seat, Mr. Force,” said the judge, and then,
turning to the young man whom he had called O’Brien,
he took from his hand a paper and began to read it to
himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was silence in the quiet room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is not a bit like I thought it was going to be. I
don’t feel at all scared now! Why, I know Judge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Blank! He used to pat me on the head every time he
saw me!” whispered Elva to Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush, hush! you mustn’t talk here. Yes, it is quiet
enough here, for that matter! Executions are quiet
nearly always. We read, ‘The execution was conducted
in a quiet and orderly manner,’ and yet a man has been
hung and choked to death, or perhaps a woman,” whispered
Wynnette, most inconsistently talking more than
the sister whom she had rebuked for breaking silence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Wynnette! why will you talk of such horrid,
horrid things?” demanded Elva, in a frightened tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because I am thinking of the price. I am counting
the cost of sending that earthworm to Hades——Hush!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The judge had finished reading the document in his
hand, and turning slowly to the respondent, said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Force, you are charged herein, under oath, by
Col. Angus Anglesea, of Anglewood Manor, England,
with having, on the twentieth of December, 18—,
forcibly abducted, and for three years past and up to
this present, illegally detained the person of his wife,
Odalite Anglesea—otherwise Odalite Force. What
have you to say to this charge?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I say that it is absolutely false and malicious from
beginning to end! The young lady here present, to
whom he so insolently refers, is my daughter, Odalite
Force, a maiden and a minor, under my own immediate
protection,” replied Abel Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Col. Angus Anglesea will step forward,” said the
venerable judge.</p>

<p class='c008'>The colonel arose, bowed and came up to the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>O’Brien handed him the New Testament.</p>

<p class='c008'>He bowed again with hypocritical devotion and took
the formal oath to speak “the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Col. Anglesea, will you now state the grounds upon
which you claim this lady here present, Odalite Force,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>or Anglesea, as your wife, and charge Abel Force, her
father, with forcibly abducting and illegally detaining
her?” said the judge.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will,” replied the colonel. And he began his statement:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Three years and four months ago, on the twentieth
of December, 18—, in the Church of All Faith, in the
Parish of All Faith, in the State of Maryland, I married
Odalite Force, here present, daughter of Abel
Force, also here present. The Rev. Dr. Peters, rector
of All Faith, performed the marriage. Mr. Abel Force
gave away the bride. At the end of the ceremony a
madwoman burst into the church, forced her way to the
altar and created a disgraceful disturbance, into the
details of which I need not go. Mr. Force, with the help
of some of his neighbors, seized his daughter, tore her
from my arms and conveyed her to his home, where he
has forcibly and illegally detained her ever since. I see
one man and several young women who were witnesses
of the whole transaction, and may be put upon the stand
to corroborate my testimony,” concluded the colonel.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Lord!” muttered one and all of the girls, aghast
at the proposition.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Col. Anglesea,” questioned the judge, “you say that
this happened more than three years ago. Why has not
this complaint been made sooner?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Imperative business summoned me immediately to
England and detained me there. I wrote many letters
to my wife, imploring her to come over to me—letters
which perhaps never reached her, for she never replied
to them. I then sent a messenger, the Rev. Dr. Pratt,
to see her in person, and try to induce her to come over
to England under his escort and join me at Anglewood,
where I impatiently awaited her. But my reverend
courier failed to find her where I had left her, at her
father’s country seat, Mondreer, and heard that she was
with her family in Washington. He came here in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>search of my wife, but again failed to meet her. He
was told that she was traveling with her family in
Canada. In short, my agent failed to find her, and returned
to England from his fruitless errand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lord! how that man can lie!—I mean, what reckless
assertions he can make!” said Wynnette, in a low tone,
to Roland.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I like your first way of putting it best,” muttered
young Bayard.</p>

<p class='c008'>Col. Anglesea was going on with his statement:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was bound to England by business, which was at
the same time a most sacred duty. It is needless to go
into the description of that business and duty. It has
nothing to do with this case further than it held me fast
from coming to this country in search of my wife; from
whom I had never heard directly since our violent parting
in the church. Nor did I hear any news of her until
last March, when a rumor reached me that she was
on the eve of marriage with a cousin of hers, a Mr.
Leonidas Force, a midshipman in the United States
Navy. I took measures to find out the truth about this
report, and having satisfied myself of it, I set sail for
New York, where I arrived only three days since. I
took the first train to Washington, and reached the city
yesterday morning. I inquired the address of Mr. Abel
Force and went directly to his house. I was refused
admittance. I asked to see my wife, but was refused
the privilege.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Lord! how that man can lie! I mean, how he
can falsify the sacred truth!” panted Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stick to the first form, my dear! The terse Saxon
is the strongest,” muttered Roland.</p>

<p class='c008'>Col. Anglesea continued:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Knowing the desperate character of the man I had
to deal with——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! just hear him talking about our gentle, lovely
papa!” whispered Elva.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>“Never mind! I’m putting it all down! He’s only
piling up ‘wrath against a day of wrath.’ Spinning out
rope enough to hang himself. I’ll give it to him! He’ll
catch it!” panted Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Knowing, I say, the character of the man I had to
deal with,” concluded Anglesea; “knowing from bitter
experience that not even the holy ground of the house of
God was sacred from his murderous violence——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Rosemary Hedge! make Roland Bayard kick that
man out of the courthouse and horsewhip him in the
public streets!” fiercely whispered Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush, hush, dear child! We are in the presence of
the judge. Wait. I will deal with him later,” murmured
young Bayard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Rosemary Hedge! tell Roland Bayard if he don’t
kick that man out and lash him, you will never marry
him!” hissed Wynnette, through her clenched teeth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He never asked me to,” replied Rosemary, in her
tiny voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Silence,” said the judge, noticing for the first time
the excited whispering in the corner.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There! I told you so! Next thing we’ll be kicked
out,” muttered Wynnette, most unreasonably, since she
herself had caused all the disturbance.</p>

<p class='c008'>A dead silence fell among the group of girls while
Anglesea went on with his statement:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I applied for, and obtained, the writ of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas corpus</span></i>
from your honor, ordering the abductor of my wife
to bring her before you. So armed with the power of
the law, I went to the house of Abel Force last night
and entered it, and not a moment too soon. I found my
wife standing with a young man whom I at once recognized
as Mr. Midshipman Force, before a minister of
the Gospel who had just pronounced the marriage benediction.
I saw the writ served, and then left the house.
I have no more to say but this, that I might have brought
a criminal charge against her!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <span class='large'>THE OTHER SIDE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The venerable judge now turned his face, impassive
as that of the Sphinx, toward Abel Force, who throughout
the trying ordeal of Anglesea’s false testimony and
insulting demeanor had maintained his self-possession
and commanded his temper.</p>

<p class='c008'>He now arose and came forward, took the prescribed
oath, and began his statement:</p>

<p class='c008'>“My daughter, Odalite Force, was never married to
Angus Anglesea. On the twentieth of December, 18—,
at All Faith Church, in Maryland, she went through a
portion of the marriage ritual with him; but that ceremony
was never completed. Before the final declaration
was delivered, before the benediction was pronounced,
the further proceedings were interrupted by
the entrance of a lady who claimed to be the wife of
Angus Anglesea, the would-be bridegroom——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“An impostor! An adventuress!” exclaimed Col. Anglesea.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And who proved herself to be the wife of Angus
Anglesea, to the satisfaction of all present, by producing
her marriage certificate.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Forgery! forgery!” exclaimed the colonel.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I took charge of the certificate at the time and have
it with me. Will your honor examine it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And Abel Force drew from his breast pocket a folded
paper which he handed to the judge.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A clever forgery, your honor!” said Anglesea, while
the judge unfolded and read the document.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This,” said the judge, slowly reading the paper, “appears
to be the certificate of the marriage of Angus
Anglesea, of Anglewood, Lancashire, England, colonel
in the Honorable East India Service, with Ann Maria
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Wright, widow, of Wild Cats’ Gulch, California. It is
signed by Paul Minitree as officiating clergyman, and
by several other persons as witnesses. What is the
meaning of this, Col. Anglesea?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is a forgery, your honor!” impudently replied the
colonel.</p>

<p class='c008'>The judge turned and looked at Abel Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So he said when it was first produced by his wife in
church,” replied the latter; “but we telegraphed to St.
Sebastian and got the record of the marriage from the
parish register of St. Sebastian telegraphed back to us,
word for word. I have preserved that telegram. Will
your honor examine it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And Mr. Force drew from his pocket a roll of what
seemed measuring tape, which he handed to the judge,
who patiently unwound and carefully read the long dispatch.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This appears to be a full corroboration. What have
you to say about it, Col. Anglesea?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I say that it is a forgery! I say that there is a conspiracy
between the woman and the priest. I deny in
toto the authenticity of the marriage certificate and of
the telegram that seems to support it. They are both
the work of the same hands. Any one who can write
may fill in the printed form of a marriage certificate.
Any one may send a telegram to any effect they please.
I repeat that I deny in toto the truth of the certificate
and of the telegram. They may be easily proven to be
false. Let an accredited agent be sent to St. Sebastian
to examine the register. It will take time, but I am
willing to wait for justice,” said the colonel, with an
appearance of candor and moderation calculated to deceive
any one who did not know him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The judge turned again and looked at Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly. I am perfectly willing, nay, extremely
anxious, that this matter should be sifted to the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>bottom. I have no doubt or fear of the result,” said
Abel Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the meantime,” said Anglesea, “I shall pray your
honor that my wife will be taken from the custody of
her father and delivered into my keeping.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That cannot be done while this question is in doubt,”
said the judge, with the same impassive face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I will pray that my wife be taken from the
custody of her father, whom I cannot trust, and placed
in that of the sheriff, or of some third party, with whom
my rights will be safe,” persisted the man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We will consider.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If your honor will adjourn the case for twenty-four
hours I will undertake to bring this man’s wife into
court. She is at present living at my country seat, Mondreer,
in the capacity of housekeeper.”</p>

<p class='c008'>An insolent, insulting laugh from Anglesea interrupted
the speaker for a moment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She is in the service of Mrs. Force, and in charge
of our country home during our absence,” continued
Abel Force, controlling his temper, and speaking quietly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You may adjourn the case, your honor, for the sake
of producing this woman; but when she shall be produced
she will be nothing more than an impostor—an
adventuress. The only true test of this question will be
to send an accredited agent to California to search the
parish register of Sebastian. Two agents may be sent,
for that matter; one on my part, one on the part of Mr.
Force. That will secure fair play; but they will find no
record of any marriage between me and any woman
whatever. How should they? Why, your honor, I was,
in that August, 18—, not in California, nor in any part
of America; not on this side of the Atlantic Ocean, but
on the other side, in England, at Anglewood Manor, attending
on my invalid first wife, Lady Mary Anglesea,
who died suddenly on the twenty-fifth of that same
August. How, then, could I have been in California,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>and married to this adventuress who has been brought
forward as my wife? Here is the notice of my first
wife’s death. You will see that it occurred on the
twenty-fifth of August, just twenty-four days after I am
stated to have married this California widow. Will
your honor be pleased to examine it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>And Anglesea drew the little printed slip from his
pocketbook, and passed it to the judge.</p>

<p class='c008'>That venerable dignitary read it, and looked somewhat
puzzled. In fact, the case was growing more involved
at every turn.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your honor must perceive that if I were in attendance
on my invalid first wife, who died on the twenty-fifth
of August, at Anglewood Manor, England, I could
not well have been in St Sebastian, California, courting
and marrying that impostor who claimed me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The judge looked exceedingly perplexed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Or if I could by any possibility have married this
Californian woman on the first of August, as the false
certificate states, that marriage would not have been
legal because my first wife was then living, and lived
until the twenty-fifth, when she died. And, consequently,
in either case, I am the husband of this young
lady, Odalite Anglesea, here present.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <span class='large'>LE’S “COUP”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>At this moment there was a slight movement at the
door, and Leonidas Force entered the room, advanced
and bowed to the judge, and then handed a written
paper to the father of Odalite.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force took the paper, read it, started, and passed
it on to the judge.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>His honor took it, read it slowly, and laid it on the
table before him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force had resumed his seat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Col. Anglesea remained standing immediately in
front of the judge.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le stood a little to the right, near the end of the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was silence for a few moments.</p>

<p class='c008'>Col. Anglesea was the first to speak again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In view of the evidence that I have offered to prove
that I am the legal husband of Odalite Anglesea, here
present, I pray your honor that my wife be delivered
into my custody, or if such may not be, then into that of
the sheriff, or of some other person whom I can trust.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Col. Anglesea,” began the judge, speaking very
slowly and deliberately, “what did you say was the date
of your first wife’s death?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The twenty-fifth of August, as you may see by the
obituary notice in your possession.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah! but in what year?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The colonel’s well-guarded face changed. He seemed
disturbed, but quickly recovered himself, and answered:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! why, in the year 18—, the same year, of course,
as well as the same month, in which I have been accused
of having married the California widow—which, as I
am not endowed with ubiquity, is impossible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You say, then, that your first wife died on August
25, 18—?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, your honor.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“On what date was this notice inserted, and in what
paper?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the London <cite>Times</cite> of the twenty-sixth. It is
usual, I believe, to publish the obituary notice on the day
after the death,” said the colonel, with great dignity, as
if he considered this cross-examination rather irrelevant,
if not even impertinent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“London <cite>Times</cite> of the twenty-sixth of August, 18—?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>“Of course. Yes, your honor,” replied the colonel,
scarcely able to control his annoyance.</p>

<p class='c008'>At that moment Le drew from his breast pocket a
folded newspaper, which he passed to Mr. Force, who,
in turn, submitted it to the judge, saying respectfully:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here, your honor, is a copy of the London <cite>Times</cite> to
which reference has been made. If your honor will examine
the obituary column, you will see that the notice
of Lady Mary Anglesea’s death is ‘conspicuous by its
absence.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>Col. Anglesea flushed and paled visibly while the
judge turned over the paper and examined it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hold here a copy of the London <cite>Times</cite> of August
25, 18—, the date you mentioned as containing the
obituary notice of your wife’s death; but I fail to find it
in the list of such notices,” said the judge.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will your honor allow me to look at that paper?”
inquired Anglesea, struggling, and partly succeeding, in
recovering his self-control.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly,” replied the judge, and he handed it over.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where did this paper come from?” frowningly inquired
Anglesea of Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>The latter gentleman replied by a wave of his hand
toward Leonidas Force, who still stood near the right-hand
end of the table before the judge.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I procured it from Mr. Henry Herbert, an English
gentleman, whose acquaintance I made since my return
from sea, and who, as I casually found out, takes the
London <cite>Times</cite>, and keeps a file of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah!” said Col. Anglesea. “I was certainly under
the strong impression that the notice of my wife’s death
was inserted in the <cite>Times</cite> of the day after the occurrence;
but, as I really had nothing to do with the matter
myself—such matters are usually attended to by the
family solicitor, minister, or some other than the chief
mourner—I could not have been certain, and should not
have undertaken to give the precise date, as to which I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>must have been mistaken. And now that I reflect upon
the matter, I remember that Lady Mary Anglesea died
at Anglewood Manor at precisely 11:53 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, on the
twenty-fifth, and, of course, the notice could not have
reached London in time for insertion in the issue of the
<cite>Times</cite> of the twenty-sixth. It may have first appeared
in the issue of the twenty-seventh, or even of the twenty-eighth,
and it may have never appeared in the <cite>Times</cite> at
all, but in some other paper. I do not know. I fear I
took the matter so for granted that the notice appeared
in the <cite>Times</cite> on the day after the death, that I spoke
hastily and unadvisedly,” concluded the colonel, with
that air of candor he could so well assume.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you must remember from what paper you cut
the notice that you have so carefully preserved,” suggested
the judge.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did not cut it from any. There, again, is another
reason why I cannot be sure of the date, or even of the
name of the paper in which it was inserted. A thoughtful
friend of the family—I do not remember who,
whether it was our rector or some other—cut it out and
gave it to me as a memento some days after the funeral.
But, your honor, it seems to me that the date of the
publication of the notice of the death is of very little
consequence, as the fact remains that the event occurred
on the twenty-fifth of August, 18—, while the marriage
with which I am charged is said to have taken place on
the first of the same month, which, if it did, was clearly
illegal and of no effect, and constitutes no barrier to the
marriage with Odalite, my present wife, which was
solemnized at All Faith in the December following.
But I say, on the contrary, that the marriage which I
myself witnessed and arrested in the house of Mr. Abel
Force, yesterday, April 1st, between Odalite Anglesea
and Leonidas Force, was illegal, criminal and felonious;
and I might now bring my wife before the criminal
court on the charge of bigamy.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>“Col. Anglesea, you will do well to remember that
this is not a criminal court, nor are we investigating a
criminal charge. And govern yourself accordingly,”
said the judge, speaking for the first time with great
severity in tone and look.</p>

<p class='c008'>Angus Anglesea bowed and was silent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As this question of my daughter’s freedom to contract
marriage has been raised, your honor, I will crave
your indulgence while I call your attention to this paper
which I hold in my hand. It is a copy of the Angleton
<cite>Advertiser</cite>, of August 20th, and contains an obituary
notice to the ‘late Angus Anglesea, of Anglewood,
colonel,’ etc., etc., with a sketch of his life and career,
and a high eulogium of his character. This paper appears
to be the organ of his family, published in his own
town of Angleton, and on his manor of Anglewood, and
should be some authority in their affairs. And yet it
publishes the death of the master of the manor, who
stands living before us. Even if my daughter had been,
as she certainly never was, the wife of Angus Anglesea,
such evidence as this—appearing to be true, though it
was false—of the death of the man whom she had not
seen for more than three years, or since her incomplete
marriage with him was broken off at the altar by the
appearance of his wife, would have seemed to leave her
free to contract marriage without a shade of reproach.
This paper was sent to me through the English mails,
in duplicates, the first of which reached me in September,
and was soon after forwarded to his wife, Mrs.
Ann Maria Anglesea, at Mondreer. The second came
three days later. Will your honor look at it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The judge took it, slowly examined the obituary notice
and glowing eulogium of the late Col. Angus Anglesea,
of Anglewood Manor, etc., etc., looked in amazement
from the death notice to the living subject, and
then laying down the sheet, with a frown, said:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>“Mr. Force, this extraordinary publication has nothing
whatever to do with the case in hand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Abel Force bowed in submission and sat down. His
point, however, was gained. The judge had seen the
paper, and could not help drawing his own conclusions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Judge Blank then arose to give his decision, and said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Col. Angus Anglesea, it is not necessary to enter
very deeply into the merits of this case. You have
failed to prove any marital rights over the person of
Odalite Anglesea, otherwise Odalite Force. I, therefore,
remand her, as a minor, into the custody of her
father, and I dismiss the case. Mr. Force, you can take
your daughter away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Abel Force bowed deeply to the judge, and walked
toward the group of ladies who were anxiously awaiting
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Col. Anglesea stepped aside to let him pass, but hissed
in his ear:</p>

<p class='c008'>“There are other tribunals. And yet I will have my
wife!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Abel Force disdained reply, but gave his arm to Odalite,
and told Le to give his to Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>And so they left the presence of the judge.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <span class='large'>AFTER THE ORDEAL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The capricious April weather had changed for the
better. The rain had ceased. The sky was clear. The
sun was shining.</p>

<p class='c008'>As our party stood on the steps of the City Hall,
waiting for their carriage to come up, Le spoke aside
to the father of Odalite:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle, it is but two o’clock. Can we not drive immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>to St. John’s rectory, and have the interrupted
marriage of yesterday completed? I suppose
we would have to begin again at the beginning and have
it all over again. Still that would give ample time to
catch the New York express train, and reach the city
in time to secure the <em>Russ a</em> for Liverpool.”</p>

<p class='c008'>While Le spoke Mr. Force regarded him with amazement.
When Le ceased Mr. Force replied:</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, certainly not, my dear boy. No such plan can
be entertained for a single moment. We do not know,
since that scoundrel’s return, whether Odalite is free to
marry. Nor shall we ever know until the date of Lady
Mary Anglesea’s death is definitely ascertained. If she
did not die until the twenty-fifth of August, 18—, as
the fellow insists that she did not, then was the ceremony
he went through with the Widow Wright no marriage
at all, and the rites performed at All Faith between
himself and Odalite legal and binding. You
know that as well as I do, Le.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The young man’s face grew dark with despair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In any case you will never give her up to him!” he
cried.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never, so help me Heaven! Nor can I give her to
you, Le, until she shall be proved to be free.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought, when the judge remanded her to your
custody and dismissed the case, it was—his action was
equivalent to declaring her free.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He had no power to do that. But in a doubtful case,
when the self-styled ‘husband’ cannot prove his right to
the woman in question, who is claimed by her father as
his unmarried daughter and a minor, it is clearly the
proper course to deliver her into the keeping of her
father, always providing the father be a proper man to
take the charge. No, Le, the judge has simply left the
case where he found it. You might have noticed, too,
that he referred to my daughter as Odalite Anglesea,
otherwise Odalite Force.’”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>“I thought he quoted that from the writ.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He did, yet his doing so was significant.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Abel, is there no way out of all this misery?
Uncle Abel, it is worse than death! Is there no
help for us under the sun?” demanded the youth, with
a gesture of despair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Le. Be patient.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have been patient for three long years, only to be
grievously disappointed at the end!” bitterly exclaimed
the boy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, Le, listen to my plan. You know that we are
all invited over to England to pay a long-promised visit
to my brother-in-law, the Earl of Enderby. You know
that you and Odalite were to have gone there after your
marriage tour to join us at Castle Enderby.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And that plan has all fallen through with the rest,”
complained Le.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not entirely, my boy. You cannot have a honeymoon
anywhere just now. But we can go abroad together,
and spend the summer in England. We can take
advantage of our visit to investigate the particulars of
Lady Mary Anglesea’s death. If we find that she died
previous to the marriage of that villain with the Widow
Wright, then was that marriage legal, and Mrs. Ann
Anglesea is Angus Anglesea’s lawful wife, and our Odalite
is free. If this should be the case, Le, I would
offer no obstacle, suggest no delay, to your immediate
marriage. By the way, Le, was that file of the <cite>Times</cite>
you spoke of a complete one?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no, sir. Nor could I find a complete file in the
city. From Mr. Herbert’s file the twenty-seventh, twenty-eighth
and thirtieth of August were missing, and
there was no notice of Lady Mary Anglesea’s death in
any that remained.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we can find a perfect file in London. We can
also find the Anglesea parish register, and possibly some
monument or tablet or memorial window of the deceased
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>lady which will give us the true date of her
death. We cannot possibly fail to find it, Le. We shall
be sure to do so. And if the discovery proves Odalite
to be free, you shall have her the next hour, or as soon
as a minister can be found to marry you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And, on the other hand, uncle, if the facts do not
show her to be legally free, still you will never, never
yield her to that man?” anxiously persisted Le.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have told you no—never! I would see her dead
first. Be assured of that. Why, Le, that scoundrel
knows that he can never touch a hair of my daughter’s
head.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then why did he enact the villainy of last night and
this morning if it were not in the hope of getting her
into his possession?” demanded the youth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He acted from a low malice, to annoy us; if possible,
to humiliate us. He knew that that was all he
could do, and he did it. There, Le. There is your car,
and the other young folks are going to board it. Follow
them, my boy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But may I not go in the carriage with you and Odalite?”
pleaded the youth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, dear boy. There is no room for you. Miss
Grandiere goes with us. We are four, and fill the four
seats. Hurry, or you will miss the car.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Le ran down the steps, and saved the car.</p>

<p class='c008'>All this time Odalite had been standing in the rear
of her father, and between her mother and her friend
Sophie Grandiere. Her veil was down, and it was so
doubled as to hide her face. All three of the ladies were
silent.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Le had left his side, Mr. Force turned toward
them, and said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I ordered the carriage to come for us at about a
quarter after two. I had no idea we should be out before
that hour, and have to wait.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“Well, we have not had long to wait, and here it
comes,” replied Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>And the party walked down the steps, entered the
carriage, and drove homeward.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Forces, except when they gave a dinner, always
kept up their old-fashioned, wholesome habit of dining
in the middle of the day. Their usual dinner hour was
half-past two, and they reached home just in time to
take off their bonnets before sitting down to the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>After dinner Mr. Force called a consultation of Mrs.
Force, Odalite, Leonidas, Wynnette, Elva and Rosemary,
in the library, for he said that all who were interested
in the question about to be raised should have a
voice in the discussion.</p>

<p class='c008'>When they were all seated he began, and said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mrs. Force and myself have called you here, my
children, to help us to decide whether, under the circumstances
that have lately arisen, we shall go to England
as soon as we can get off, or whether we shall carry out
our first intention of waiting until June for the school
commencement at which you three younger ones expect
to graduate. Court-martial fashion, we will begin with
our youngest. Little Rosemary, what do you think
about it? Shall we wait two months longer, until you
graduate, or shall we go at once? You are to go with
us whenever we go, and so you are an interested party,
you know. Come, speak up, without fear or favor!”</p>

<p class='c008'>But it was no easy matter to get the tiny creature
to speak at all.</p>

<p class='c008'>Looking down, fingering her apron, she managed at
last to express her opinion that Mr. and Mrs. Force
ought to decide for them all.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, no! That won’t do at all! No shirking your
duty, Liliputian! Tell us what you think,” laughed the
master of the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well—then—I—think—it would be nice to go at
once.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“And miss your scholastic honors?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” muttered the child, looking shyly up from her
long eyelashes. “I would rather miss them than miss
going to England.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right. One for the immediate voyage. Now,
Elva?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Papa, I wish you would let Odalite settle the question.
We all would like Odalite to have her own way,”
said the affectionate little sister.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Quite right; we shall come to Odalite presently; but,
in the meantime, we want your own unbiased feeling
about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Indeed, indeed, my feeling is to do just what Odalite
wants me to do! Please, please, let me hear what
Odalite says before I decide.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well, then, so you shall. Now, Wynnette?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Papa, I think we had best go at once. It is very
warm here in the latter part of May, and all through
June, and it will be so delightful on the ocean——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But your graduation, Wynnette?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, papa! we shall not lose anything by losing those
exercises. We are learning nothing new now. We are
going over and over the old ground to make ourselves
verbally perfect for the examination. So, indeed, by
leaving school at once we shall lose nothing but the
parade of the commencement.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We score two votes for the immediate voyage. Odalite,
my dear, you have the floor.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Papa, if I could go to Europe immediately without
detriment to the education of these girls, I should be
very glad to go. But I think everything should yield
to the interests of their education,” said Odalite.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have heard what Wynnette says, my dear—that
they are adding nothing to their stock of knowledge
in the last two months at school. Only perfecting themselves,
in parrot-like verbiage, to answer questions at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>the coming examination. They will lose nothing but the
pageantry of the exhibition.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then, papa, I think I would like to go very soon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now, so would I, papa,” put in Elva.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Quite so! Four in favor of the voyage. Now, Le?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle, you know my anxiety that we be off. I
would go by telegraph, if I could.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Five! Well, my dears, Mrs. Force and myself are
already agreed that, upon all accounts, it is best that we
should sail by the first Liverpool steamship on which
we can procure staterooms for so large a party as ours is
likely to be. I will write to the agent of the Cunard
line by to-night’s mail. It is very necessary that we
should go to England, without delay, not only to see
our relative, Lord Enderby, whose health is in a very
precarious condition, but also to investigate matters in
which Odalite’s and Le’s welfare and happiness are
deeply concerned. Rosemary, my dear, write and tell
your aunt of our changed plans in regard to the time
of the voyage. Children, this is the second of April. I
think we will be able to sail by the twenty-third, at
furthest. So you may all begin to get ready for your
voyage,” said Mr. Force, rising to break up the conference.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <span class='large'>PREPARING TO LEAVE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Force went at once to his writing desk to write
letters—one to the New York agent of the Cunard line
of ocean steamers; another to his overseer at Mondreer,
and a third to Miss Grandiere.</p>

<p class='c008'>When all these were dispatched he joined his family
circle in the parlor.</p>

<p class='c008'>The talk ran on events of the day.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“The proceedings were much less formal than I had
supposed they would be,” Mrs. Force remarked.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“This reminds me of the first <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas corpus</span></i> case I
ever witnessed. In my youth I was traveling in the far
West, and stopped, to get over an attack of chills, at the
first house that would take me in. It was a better sort
of log cabin, on the farm of Judge Starr, one of the
judges of the Supreme Court of the State; and it was
occupied by the judge, his wife and a hired boy. I had
to sleep in the loft with the hired boy. The judge
and his wife occupied the room below as parlor, bedroom,
dining room and kitchen——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, what living for civilized and enlightened human
beings!” exclaimed Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He lives in a five-hundred-thousand-dollar house
now, my dear, and if it were not irreverent to say so,
I might almost add that his ‘cattle’ are ‘upon a thousand
hills.’ But that is not the point now. On the morning
after my arrival I heard the judge say to his wife—for
you could hear through the gaping planks of the loft
floor every word that was spoken in the room below—I
heard him say:</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘That case of little Valley Henley will come up to-day.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Will it?’ she replied. ‘Well, I’ll tell you what to
do, Nick! You leave it to the child herself.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘I will,’ said the judge.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And yet they say women have no power! And
here was the wife of one of the judges of the supreme
court of the State, ordering him what to do!” exclaimed
Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” continued Mr. Force, “about ten o’clock, having
taken a warm cup of coffee, brought up to me by
Mrs. Judge, and having got over the fever that followed
the chill, I arose and dressed and went downstairs.
But Mrs. Judge was ‘in the suds,’ and the room was full
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>of hot steam; so I walked out into the back yard, where
I found the judge in his red shirt sleeves, sawing wood.
Almost before I could say good-morning, came the hired
boy and proclaimed:</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘They’re come.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Bring them right in here,’ said the judge, and he
threw down his saw and seated himself astraddle the
log on the wood horse.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And then came half a dozen or more of men with a
pale, scared little girl among them. An orphan child,
she was, with plenty of money, and she was claimed by
two uncles, one of whom had taken out a writ of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas
corpus</span></i>, to compel the other to bring her before the judge,
to decide who should have her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, there was a lawyer on each side, and witnesses
on each side, and plenty of hard swearing and bold lying
on both sides. And the judge sat in his red flannel shirt
sleeves, astride the log on the wood horse, and stroked
his stubble beard of a week’s growth, and listened patiently.
The poor little object of dispute stood and trembled,
until the judge noticed her and lifted her upon his
knees, put his arm around her waist and held her there,
saying:</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Don’t be afraid, little woman. No one shall hurt
you in any way.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“And the child plucked up her little spirits, and the
judge listened first to one lawyer and then to the other,
while they each exhausted all their law on the case, without
affecting the issue in the least degree—for the result
lay in the will of that helpless, orphan child, whose little
head lay against the judge’s red shirt. While they all
talked themselves hoarse, the judge listened gravely, but
spoke never a word.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And Mrs. Judge came in and out of the yard, hanging
her clothes on the line.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When they could talk no longer they were obliged to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>be silent, and then the judge lifted the child’s head from
his bosom, sat her up straight, and asked her:</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Now, my little woman, let us hear what you have
got to say, as you are the most interested party. Which
uncle had you rather go and live with?’</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was some time before the frightened child found
courage to open her lips, but when, reassured by the
manner of the judge, she did speak, it was to the purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Oh, sir, please, I want to go back to dear Uncle
Ben! Mamma did leave me to Uncle Ben; indeed, indeed,
the Lord knows that she did! And I don’t know
Mr. Holloway! And no more did she! I never saw
Mr. Holloway till he came here after me to take me
away off to Portland.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Very well, you shall go back to Uncle Ben,’ said
the judge, and raising his voice, he continued: ‘Mr.
Benjamin Truman, here is your niece and ward. Take
her, and take care of her.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“A rough backwoodsman came forward and took the
little maiden in his arms and kissed her, and then
touched his hat to the judge on the wood horse and led
the happy child away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And then a polished gentleman threw himself into a
passion, and used objectionable language that might
have subjected him to fine and imprisonment, had the
law been administered to him in its severity. But the
good judge only said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘If you are not satisfied, there’s the orphans’ court—though,
I have no doubt, that also would leave the
child in the custody of her present guardian.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“And with this the judge got off his ‘bench,’ took up
his saw and resumed his work.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And half the crowd went off swearing and threatening,
and the other half laughing and cheering. That
was my first experience in <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas corpus</span></i>. Judge Starr
has risen to wealth, power and position since then; children
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>came to him among other good gifts, and his eldest
daughter has lately married an English nobleman, who
is quite as noble ‘in nature as in rank.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I like that judge! I am glad he rose in the
world!” exclaimed little Elva.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I would like to see him,” murmured poor Odalite,
won for the moment from the contemplation of her own
woes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My love, for the last three years you have met him
many, many times,” said her father.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Met him!—here, in Washington? But I don’t remember
any Judge Starr.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That was a fictitious name. I could not use his real
name in telling such a story—though I don’t know why,
either. But, my dear, he is now one of the judges of
the Supreme Court of the United States. You cannot
fail to identify him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I know! I know!” exclaimed Odalite, with a
bright smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who was it? Which was it? What was his name?”
came in a dozen tones from the young people present.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No; since papa has not named him, I must not,” said
Odalite.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then the sound of the supper bell summoned
them to the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two days after that Mr. Force received a letter from
the New York agent of the Cunard line of steamers, telling
him that the first steamer on which they could accommodate
so large a party as the Forces’ would be the
<em>Persia</em>, which would sail on the twenty-eighth of May.
There were not so many ocean steamers then as now,
and people had to secure their passages a long way beforehand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The twenty-eighth of may! Nearly two months!
What a nuisance! But it is because there are so many
of us! Seven cabin passengers for the first, and two for
the second cabin! However, wife, I will tell you what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>we will do: We will go down to Mondreer to spend the
intervening time; and we will give up this house at
once. You know our lease expired on the first of April—two
days ago—and we are only staying here a few
days on sufferance, because the house is not wanted at
this season. Yes; we will go down to Mondreer. What
do you say?” inquired Abel Force of his wife, to whom
he had just read the agent’s letter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We will go down to Mondreer as soon as the Grandieres
have finished their visit. We invited them for a
week, you know, and they have been here but three days,
and have seen but little of the city. And as to the house,
I suppose we will pay at the same rate at which we
leased it, so long as we shall stay,” replied Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>The evening mail brought a letter from Beever, the
overseer at Mondreer, giving good accounts of the estate;
and also a letter from Miss Grandiere, acquiescing
in Mr. Force’s plans, and begging on the part of her
sister, Mrs. Hedge, as well as on her own, that Mr. and
Mrs. Force would use their own judgment in all matters
connected with Rosemary and the voyage; only stipulating
that the child should be sent home to visit her
friends before going abroad.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force wrote and mailed three letters that afternoon.
One to the New York agent of the Cunard steamships,
engaging accommodations for his whole party for
the <em>Persia</em>, on the twenty-eighth of May; another to
Beever, expressing satisfaction at the report of affairs
at Mondreer, and announcing his speedy return with his
family to their country home; and a third to Miss Grandiere,
telling her that Rosemary would be with her in a
few days.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Mr. Force turned his attention to the young
guests of the family, and put himself out a little to show
them around Washington City and its suburbs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Force, meanwhile, at the head of her household,
was busy with her packing and other preparations for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>their removal to Mondreer and their after voyage to
Europe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every day she sent off boxes by express to Mondreer.</p>

<p class='c008'>And so the week passed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing, meantime, had been heard of Col. Anglesea,
until Mr. Force put a private detective upon his track,
who reported, at the end of the week, that the colonel
had left Washington for Quebec.</p>

<p class='c008'>That was a relief, at least.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the tenth of April before the Grandieres finally
concluded to return home, and then Mrs. Force, supported
by her own girls, begged that they would remain
until the whole family were ready to go to Mondreer,
that all might travel together; for the lady did not wish
that the news of Odalite’s second interrupted wedding
should reach the neighborhood and get distorted by gossip
before their own return to their country home.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was, therefore, on a fine day, the twelfth of April,
that the large party of family and guests left the city
home in the care of the janitor sent by the landlord, and
took the train en route for Mondreer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <span class='large'>FAREWELL VISIT TO MONDREER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was a long day’s ride, and it was dark when their
train ran into the little station where it stopped for half
a minute.</p>

<p class='c008'>The large party got out, and they found a much
larger party collected to meet them.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was old Tom Grandiere—as the master of Oldfield
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>was beginning to be called—with an ox cart to
carry his tribe of sons and daughters home.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was William Elk, with an old barouche which
he had brought to meet his niece.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was Miss Sibby Bayard in her mule cart, come
to fetch Roland.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lastly, there was Mrs. Anglesea, in the capacious
break, driven by Jacob, come to fetch the whole Force
family home from the station to Mondreer.</p>

<p class='c008'>And there were such hearty, cordial greetings as are
seldom heard in this world.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Welcome home, neighbors!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We have missed you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank Heaven you have come back!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And so on and so on! All speaking at once, so that it
was difficult to tell who said what, or to reply distinctly
to anything.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet the Forces all responded in the most cordial manner
to these effusive greetings, in which Mrs. Force and
Odalite detected an undertone of sadness and sympathy
which both mother and daughter understood too well.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They have heard of our new humiliation, although
we have never written of it! Yes, they have all heard
of it, though no one alludes to it,” was the unuttered
thought of mother and daughter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lord’s sake, ole man, hoist them children up here
and get in! Don’t stand palavering with them people all
night! I’m gwine to drive you all home myself. I only
brought him for show! I wouldn’t trust him to take
us home safe over bad roads in the dark,” said Mrs.
Anglesea, from her seat on the box beside the coachman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, my girls and boys, have you been so spoiled by
your gay city life that you will never be content with
your dull, country home again?” demanded Thomas
Grandiere, as he helped his big daughters to tumble up
into the ox cart.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dad, it was perfectly delightful! But we are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>glad to get home and see you, for all that!” answered
Sophie.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“‘There’s no place like home,’”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>sentimentally sighed Peggy. And all the other sisters
and the brothers chimed in with her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Washington is well enough, but they are all too indifferent
about the crops ever to amount to much, I
think,” said Sam Grandiere, and his brother Ned seconded
the motion. And so that party waved a last adieu
to the Forces and drove off.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your mother and your aunt are both at our house,
Rosemary, and so I came to fetch you over there,” said
William Elk, as he helped his little mite of a niece into
the old barouche. “You don’t grow a bit, child! Are
you never going to be a woman?” he further inquired,
as he settled her into her seat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nature puts her finest essences into her tiniest receptacles,
Uncle Elk!” said Roland, who called everybody
else’s uncle his own.</p>

<p class='c008'>But William Elk had driven off without receiving the
benefit of the young man’s words.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Roland, come here and get into this cart afore this
here brute goes to sleep and drops down. There’s a time
for all things, sez I, and the time to stand staring after
a young gal, sez I, isn’t nine o’clock at night when
there’s an ole ’oman and wicious mule on a cart waitin’
for you, and a mighty dark night and a rough road afore
you, sez I!” called Miss Sibby, from her seat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, aunty, I’m coming.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And the young fellow jumped into the cart, took the
reins from the old lady, and started the mule at a speed
that made the animal cock his ears and meditate rebellion.</p>

<p class='c008'>By this time Mr. and Mrs. Force, their three daughters
and Leonidas were seated in the break.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Anglesea was on the box, driving. This she so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>insisted on doing that there was no preventing her except
by enacting a scene.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jake’s getting old, and blind, and stupid. I’m not
going to trust my precious neck to him, you bet! I have
lost a good deal, but I want to keep my head on my
shoulders,” she had said, as she took the reins from
Jake, who immediately folded his arms, closed his eyes
and resigned himself to sleep.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You had better let me drive if you are afraid to
trust Jake, Mrs. Anglesea,” suggested Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You!” said the lady from Wild Cats’, in a tone of ineffable
contempt. “Not much! I’d a heap rather trust
Jake than you! Why, ole man, you never were a good
whip since I knowed you, and you’ve been out of practice
three years! Sit still and make yourself comfortable,
and I’ll land you safe at Mondreer. Old Luce will have
a comfortable tea there for you, and strawberry shortcake,
too. Think of strawberries on the twelfth of April!
But I raised ’em under glass. And so my beat wasn’t
dead, after all! And I in mourning for him ever since
the fourteenth of February! Well, my beat beats all!
I shall never believe him dead until I see him strung
up by a hangman and cut up by the doctors—of which
I live in hopes! No, you needn’t worry. Jake’s fast
asleep, and he wouldn’t hear thunder, nor even the dinner
horn, much less my talk!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How did you hear that Col. Anglesea had turned up
again?” inquired Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, Lord! ole man, it’s all over the whole country.
You couldn’t cork up and seal down news like that! It
would bu’st the bottle! I believe some one fetched it
down from Washington to the Calvert House, and then
it got all over the country; and Lord love you, Jake
heard it at the post office and fetched it home to the
house. And then—when Beever got your letter, and
not a word was said about the wedding, and Miss Grandiere
got two—one from you and one from Rosemary—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>nothing said neither about no brides nor grooms, we
felt to see how it was. And now there’s lynching parties
sworn in all over the neighborhood to put an end to that
beat if ever he dares to show his face here again. Oh!
the whole neighborhood is up in arms, I tell you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am very sorry my good neighbors’ sympathy
demonstrates itself in that way,” said Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can’t help it, though!” triumphantly exclaimed
the lady from the diggings, as she gave the off horse a
sharp cut that started the whole team in a gallop, and
jerked all the party out of their seats and into them
again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As a magistrate, it is my bounden duty to help it,”
returned Mr. Force, as soon as he recovered from the
jolt.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here, ole man! You take a fool’s advice and
lay low and say nothing when lynch law is going round
seeking whom it may devour! For when it has feasted
on one wictim it licks its chops and looks round for another,
and wouldn’t mind gobbling up a magistrate or
two any more than you would so many oysters! Leastways
that is how it was at Wild Cats’. And I tell you,
our boys out there woudn’t have let a beat like him cumber
the face of the earth twenty-four hours after his first
performance, if they could have got hold of him. It’s
a word and a blow with them, and the blow comes first!
Now, for goodness’ sake, do stop talking, ole man! I
can’t listen to you and drive down this steep hill at the
same time without danger of upsetting! Whoa, Jessie!
What y’re ’bout, Jack? Stea—dee!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And the lady on the box gave her whole attention to
taking her team safely down Chincapin Hill and across
the bridge over Chincapin Creek.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! how glad I am to see the dear old woods and the
creek and the bridge once more!” said little Elva, fervently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘See!’ Why, you can’t see a mite of it! It is as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>dark here as the bottom of a shaft at midnight. No
moon. And what light the stars might give hid by the
meeting of the trees overhead. ‘See,’ indeed! There’s
imagination for you!” replied Mrs. Anglesea.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, anyhow I know we are on the dear old bridge,
and going over the creek, because I can hear the sound
of the wheels on the planks and the gurgle of the water
running through the rocks and stones,” deprecatingly
replied Elva.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why don’t you say ecstatically—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Hail! blest scenes of my childhood!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>That’s the way to go on if you mean to do it up brown!”
chaffed Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, how can you be such a mocker! Are you not
glad to get home?” pleaded Elva.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Rather; but I’m not in raptures over it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look here, young uns! Stop talking; you distract
me. I can’t listen and drive at the same time. And if
you will keep on jawing you’ll get upset. These roads
are awful bad washed by the spring rains, and if we get
home safe it will be all owing to my good driving! Only
you mustn’t distract me by jawing!” said Mrs. Anglesea.
And having silenced every tongue but her own, she
drove on slowly by the light of the carriage lanterns,
which only shed a little stream directly in front of her,
talking all the time about the negligence of the supervisors
and the carelessness of the farmers in suffering
the roads to be in such a condition at that time of the
year.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This could never a been the case if you’d been home,
ole man! You’d a been after them supervisors with a
sharp stick, you would! But, Lord! the don’t-care-ishness
of the men about here!” she concluded, as she drew
up at the first broad gate across the road leading into
the Mondreer grounds.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Her passengers thought, but did not say, that if the
lady on the box could not listen and drive at the same
time, she could certainly drive and talk pretty continuously
at the same time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here, you lazy nigger, Jake! Wake up and jump
down and open this here gate!” exclaimed Mrs. Anglesea,
giving the old sleeper such a sharp grip and hard
shake that he yelled before he woke and said he dreamed
a limb of a tree had caught him and knocked him out
of his seat.</p>

<p class='c008'>However, he soon came to a sense of the situation, half
climbed and half tumbled down to the ground and
opened the gate to let the break pass through.</p>

<p class='c008'>The house was now in sight and lighted up from garret
to basement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, how pretty!” cried Elva.</p>

<p class='c008'>And Wynnette mocked her good-humoredly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I told Luce to do it and leave all the window shutters
open so you could see through. Lord! tallow candles are
cheap enough, ’specially when you make ’em yourself.
And there was an awful lot of beef tallow last killing to
render down. I couldn’t tell you how many candles I
run—about five hundred, I reckon! Well, here we are
at the house, and——Oh, Lord! Jake, jump down and
hold that dog, or he’ll break his chain and jump through
the carriage windows!” cried Mrs. Anglesea, as they
stopped before the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>Indeed, Joshua was making “the welkin ring” with
his joyous barks and his frantic efforts to get at the
returning friends, whose presence he had scented.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let him loose this instant, Jake! Unchain him, I
say!” exclaimed Wynnette. And without waiting for
her orders to be obeyed, she sprang from the carriage,
fell upon the dog’s neck, and covered him with caresses.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you dear, good, true, trusty old fellow! To know
us all again after so many years! To be so glad to see
us! And to forgive us at once for going away and leaving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>you behind. You would never have left us, would
you, my dog? Ah! dogs are a great deal more faithful
than human beings.”</p>

<p class='c008'>While Wynnette with her own hands unloosed the
chain, the other members of the family alighted from
the break.</p>

<p class='c008'>And Joshua, released from restraint, dashed into the
midst of the group, barking in frantic raptures, and
darting from one to another trying to turn himself into
a half a dozen dogs to worship at once a half a dozen
false gods in the form of his returning friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>They all responded to Joshua’s demonstrations, and
then entered the house, closely followed by the dog, who
did not mean to lose sight of them again.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the lighted hall they found all the family servants
gathered to welcome them home.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, dear mist’ess, we-dem all frought as you-dem
had forsook us forever and ever, amen!” said Luce,
bursting into tears, as she took and kissed the hand her
mistress offered.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <span class='large'>LE’S PLAN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>When all the greetings were over the family were
allowed to go upstairs—still in custody of the dog, who
kept his eye on them—and take off their traveling suits.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Anglesea walked ahead to see that every one was
comfortable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every bedroom was perfectly ready for its occupant,
well lighted by candles in silver candlesticks on the mantelpiece
and on the dressing bureau, and well warmed
by a bright little wood fire in the open fireplace, which
this chilly April evening rendered very pleasant.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One thing I do grieve to part with, even in the lovely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>spring, and that is our beautiful open wood fires!” said
Elva, as she sat down on the rug, with Joshua lying
beside her, before the fire in the bedroom occupied by
Wynnette and herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So do I! I am always glad when a real cool evening
comes to give us an excuse to kindle one,” Wynnette
assented.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the tea bell rang, and they had to leave the bright
attraction, and, closely attended by Joshua, who resolved
to keep them in view, go down to the dining room, where
all the family were assembled.</p>

<p class='c008'>This apartment was also brightly lighted by a chandelier,
which hung from the ceiling over the well-spread
table, and warmed by a clear little wood fire in the open
chimney.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Strawberries and wood fires! The charms of summer
and winter meeting in spring!” exclaimed Wynnette,
glancing from the open chimney to the piled-up
glass bowl of luscious fruit that stood as the crowning
glory of the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Raised under glass, honey. And a time I had to
keep the little niggers from stealing them! Children
may be little angels, but I never seed one yet as wouldn’t
steal fruit when it could get a chance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think they instinctively believe that all the fruit
that grows belongs to them, or at least, as much of it as
ever they want, and—maybe they are right,” said Mr.
Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s pretty morality to teach the young uns! You
ought to be ashamed of yourself, ole man. That’s not
my way, nohow. I spanked every one of them little
niggers with a fine new shingle until they roared again,
every time I caught ’em at the strawberries; and, providentially,
there were plenty of new shingles handy—left
by the carpenters who put the new roof on the back
porch,” said the lady from the mines.</p>

<p class='c008'>But no one replied; and as Mrs. Force had taken her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>seat at the head of the table, all the party gathered
around, while the dog stretched himself on the rug before
the fire and watched his family. They wouldn’t
get away again for parts unknown, and stay three years—not
if he knew it!</p>

<p class='c008'>It was late when they sat down to tea, but as they
were all very hungry, and this was their first meal at
home after years of absence, they lingered long around
the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>And when at last they arose and went into the drawing
room, still “dogged” by Joshua, it was only for a
short chat around the fire, and then a separation for the
night.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jake, put that dog out,” said Mrs. Anglesea, who
could not all at once forget to give orders in the house
she had ruled for three years, even now when the mistress
was present.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jake advanced toward the brute, but Joshua laid himself
down at Wynnette’s feet and showed all his fangs
in deadly fashion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Deed, missis, it’s as much as my life’s worf to tech
dat dorg now,” pleaded Jake.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let Joshua alone,” said Wynnette; “he shall sleep
on the rug in my room, shan’t you, good dog?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Joshua growled a reply that was perfectly well understood
by Wynnette to mean that he certainly should do
that very thing in spite of all the wildcat women in
creation.</p>

<p class='c008'>And so when all went upstairs, the dog trotted up
soberly after his little mistress, and when the latter
reached their room, he laid himself down contentedly on
the rug, and watched until he saw them abed and asleep.
Then he resigned himself to rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! the rapture of being at home again!” breathed
little Elva, standing on the rose-wreathed front piazza,
and looking forth upon the splendid April morning,
when the sky was blue, and the bay was blue, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>forest trees of tenderest green, and the orchard trees
with apple blossoms, peach blossoms, all like one vast
parterre of blossoming flowers; and the tulips, hyacinths,
jonquils, daffodils, pansies, japonicas, and all the wealth
and splendor of spring bloom on the flower beds on the
lawn were radiant with color and redolent of perfume.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! the rapture of being at home!” said little Elva,
softly to herself, as she gazed on the scene.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Hail, blest scenes of my childhood!’” sentimentally
murmured a voice behind her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Elva turned quickly, and saw, as she expected to see,
the mocking face of Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Wynnette! how can you make such fun of me!”
inquired Elva, in an aggrieved tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To prevent other things making a fool of you. Come
in, now, to breakfast. They are all down, and I came
out to look for you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girls went in together, and took their places at
the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the breakfast was over, Le asked his uncle for
the loan of a horse to ride over to Greenbushes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to take a look at the little place, which I have
not seen for three years and more,” he explained.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, certainly, Le. Take any horse you like. And
never think it necessary to ask me. Are you not as a son
to me?” said Abel Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did hope to be your son, sir, in every possible sense
of the word, but that hope seems dead now,” sighed the
young man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not at all, Le! We have only to prove a fraud in
the alteration of the date of Lady Mary Anglesea’s death
to set aside every imaginary barrier between you and
Odalite.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, sir, he denies that there ever was any marriage
between himself and this Californian lady. He declares
that it is all a conspiracy between the woman and the
priest, that the marriage certificate is a forgery, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>telegram a fraud, and he defied us to go or send to St.
Sebastian to test the matter. Now if this Californian
lady is not Anglesea’s wife——” Le paused. He could
not bring himself to conclude the sentence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If the Californian is not his wife, Odalite is, no matter
at which date the first wife died,” said Mr. Force,
finishing the unspoken argument.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, that is what I meant to say—only I could not.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear Le, have you the least doubt as to the reality
of that St. Sebastian marriage, whatever may be said of
its legality?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, none in the world. Still I want further proof
of it. I want to go to St. Sebastian and search the
parish register, as he challenged us to do!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bah! He only did that out of bravado, to annoy us
and to gain time. He no more believed that we would
either go or send to St. Sebastian than he believed that
he would ever be permitted to touch the tip of Odalite’s
finger as long as he should live in this world! He acted
from a low spite, without the slightest hope of any other
success.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Notwithstanding that, Uncle Abel, upon reflection,
I shall go to California and search that parish register
and bring back with me absolute, unquestionable proof
of that marriage to take with us to England. Then,
when we can prove that Lady Mary Anglesea’s death
occurred before Col. Anglesea’s second marriage, we
shall know Odalite to be free to become my wife. Don’t
you see?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Le; but when do you propose to go to California
on this quest? You know we sail for England in
six weeks from this.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall start to-morrow, and lose no time! travel
express! do my work as quickly as it can be done thoroughly—for
to do it most thoroughly must be my first
care—then I shall travel express coming home, and so
be back again as soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>“Well, my boy, go!” said Mr. Force. “I approve
your earnestness, and may Heaven speed you.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <span class='large'>WHAT FOLLOWED THE RETURN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Now, ole ’oman, I want you to go all over the house
’long o’ me, to see for yourself how I’ve done my duty,”
said the lady from Wild Cats’, as she followed Mrs.
Force from the breakfast room on the day after the
return of the family to Mondreer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Indeed, Mrs. Anglesea, I have no doubt you have
done perfectly well,” replied the mistress of the house,
deprecatingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, but I want you to see that I have. Now come
into the storeroom,” said the housekeeper, resolutely
leading the way, while Mrs. Force obediently followed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now look at them there rows of pickles and preserves,
and jams and jellies, on them there shelves. All
made by my own hands. Them on the top shelf is three
years old, and all the better for their age. Them on the
middle shelf was made last year, and is very good.
Them on the bottom shelf is the newest, and wants a
little more age on ’em.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid you worked too hard in making up these
things, and also denied yourself the use of them, since
the shelves are so full.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who? Me? Not much! I own I did work hard.
I like work. But as to denying myself anything good to
eat, jest you catch yours to command at it, if you can;
and if you do, jest let me know, so I can consult a mad
doctor to find out what’s the matter with my thinking
machine. No, ma’am. I don’t deny myself nothing
good to eat. You bet your pile on that. Fasting never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>was no means of grace to me. I had plenty of pickles
and preserves at all the three meals of the day. And so
had the two niggers. Lord! why, next to eating myself,
I love dearly to see other people eat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am very glad you enjoyed yourself,” said Mrs.
Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You bet! And now look into this closet, and see the
dried yerbs and roots and berries I have got here. See
now!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A great store, indeed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All gathered by my own hands, and with the dew on
’em, before the sun was up, and shaken and dried in the
shade by me. And now look here at this shelf full of
boxes of honey. I ’tended to it all myself. I hived
eleven swarms of bees since you have been gone. And I
did want to complete the dozen so much. But, Lord! it
is always so. Just because I wanted to, they got away
while I was at church one Sunday morning. You can’t
beat any religion into bees. They didn’t mind breaking
the Sabbath no more than a wild Indian. But I’ll more
than make up that dozen next season, you bet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have done admirably well to have saved so
many.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Think so? Well, now come out into the meat house,
and see the barrels of salt pork and beef, all corned by
my own hands, and the sugar-cured hams and the smoked
tongues. Oh, I tell you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Force followed her manager out of a back door
into a paved yard and across it, to a small detached
building of stone, set apart for the purpose to which the
able housekeeper had put it.</p>

<p class='c008'>We cannot follow the two women through all the
round of inspection, into the smoke houses, meat houses,
poultry yards, etc., but will only add that the lady was
gratified by all she saw, and was liberal in commendation
of her deputy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now come into the house, and we’ll go upstairs into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>the linen room, and then up into the garret to look at the
carpet and woolen curtains, and blankets and things,
laid up in lavender for the summer, and if you find a
hole unmended in anything whatsoever, or a patch put
on crooked, jest you let me know it, will you, and I’ll go
right straight off and consult that same mad doctor I
mentioned before, to see if anything’s the matter with
my headpiece.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When the inspection of the house was entirely over
Mrs. Force was very earnest in her expressions of satisfaction
and gratitude to the faithful and capable manager.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are a much better housekeeper than I ever was,
Mrs. Anglesea,” she said, as they came downstairs together.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why wouldn’t I be? Gifts is divers. You’ve got a
gift of working in silks and worsteds, and beads and
things, and playing on the pianoforty, and speaking in
all the lingoes of the Tower of Babel. But you can’t
keep house worth a cent. And the Lord knows what
would a-become of you all if it had not been for ole Aunt
Lucy. Now she’s a fairish sort of a manager, though
she can’t come up to me. No, ma’am! I never graduated
from no college. I can’t play on nothing but the
Jew’s-harp, and I can’t speak any language but what I
learned at my ole mother’s knee. But, Lord! as for
good housekeeping and downright useful hard working,
I can whip the coat offen the back of any man or any
woman going.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think that few can excel you,” said Mrs. Force, as
they entered the little parlor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You bet!” said the lady from the diggings, as she
dropped heavily into an armchair and panted. “And I
didn’t learn to keep house at Wild Cats’, neither! Lord,
no; there wasn’t much chance to keep house in a log
cabin with a dirt floor, and not even a loft or a lean-to!
It was from my good ole mother I learned all I know!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>And little use it was to me at Wild Cats’. And, oh!
when I think of the gold diggings, and my poor ole man
leaving of a comfortable home to go and live in a poor
shanty, and dig in the bowels of the earth for nigh eleven
years to make his pile, and then to die and leave it all
behind for that grand vilyan to rob me of——But
there! Lord, what’s the use of thinking of it when I’ve
got as fine a goose in the roaster before the kitchen fire
as ever swam upon a pond, as rich a green gooseberry pie
in the oven as ever was baked! And so, ole ’oman, I’ll
leave yer now, ’cause I can’t trust ole Luce! She ain’t
the ’oman she used to be by a long shot. She’s sort o’
getting blind, I think,” concluded the housekeeper, as
she arose and left the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Force sat back in her chair to rest after her tour
of the house and yard.</p>

<p class='c008'>While thus resting she heard the sound of carriage
wheels, and then a gay bustle before the front door, the
voices of Wynnette and Elva mingled with the voices of
a lady and gentleman, the laughing of a child, the crowing
of a baby, and the barking of a dog.</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently the hall door opened and all this merry confusion
of sounds rolled into the hall and into the drawing
room.</p>

<p class='c008'>And before Mrs. Force could arise from her chair to
go and see what could be the matter, her door was suddenly
thrown open and Wynnette, all aglow with excitement,
burst into the room, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, mamma! It is Natalie! Dear Natalie and—and
two babies! Dr. Ingle brought them in his gig, and
he is only waiting to speak to you, to leave them here
while he goes his round among his patients, and then he
will call and take them home! But, oh, mamma, I
want you to make him promise to come back and stay to
dinner and spend the evening—will you? Oh, mamma,
Natty is looking so lovely, and her babies are just
heavenly!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>“My dear, impetuous Wynnette, stop and take breath!
Of course Natalie and her children must spend the day,
and the doctor must return to dinner. Come! I will
go to them,” said Mrs. Force, as she arose and went into
the drawing room, followed by the delighted Wynnette.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXV<br /> <span class='large'>THE FIRST VISITORS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As soon as Mrs. Force opened the door Dr. Ingle
stepped rapidly to meet her, with both hands extended.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Welcome back to us! Dear friend! Only this morning
we heard of your arrival through Ned Grandiere,
who came to my office early to ask me to call and see
one of the colored folks on his farm; but Natalie immediately
took a fit, and declared that I must bring her
and the babies here before going anywhere else! So
here they are, and now I must be off to Oldfields.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Before the doctor had half finished this speech Natalie
herself was in Mrs. Force’s arms, laughing and crying
for joy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, well! I must say good-by, madam!” exclaimed
the doctor, rather impatiently, as he held out his
hands to the lady of the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I suppose I must not detain you from your patients;
but I cannot let you go until you have promised to return
to dinner, and to spend the evening with us,” said
Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thank you! I promise! Good-morning!” And
the doctor bowed himself out of the drawing room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you sweet little thing! You lovely, lovely little
thing!” cooed Elva, seated upon a hassock, with the few
months old baby across her lap.</p>

<p class='c008'>“These are your children, Natalie? What fine children
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>they are,” said Mrs. Force, as they all resumed
their seats.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you think so? I am glad you think so,” replied
the proud young mother. “Come here, Effie, and speak
to this lady,” she continued, taking a little, white-robed
toddler by the hand and leading her up to Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>The little one stood before the lady, with her chin
down on her bosom, and her soft brown eyes turned
shyly up to her hostess.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Make your courtesy now to the lady,” said her
mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>The little creature obeyed and dropped her courtesy,
still turning her soft brown eyes, full of reverence and
admiration, up to her hostess’ face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So this is my little namesake?” said Mrs. Force,
lifting the child upon her lap.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, named Elfrida, for you and Elva; but we call
her Effie, and she calls herself Essie,” said the young
mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah! is that your name, little one?” inquired the
lady, stroking the child’s curls.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Es, ma’am—Essie,” replied the baby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And what else besides Essie?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Essie—Indy, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Essie Ingle—is that it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Es, ma’am; Essie—Indy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And how old are you, Essie?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Me—two—doin’ on fee.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Force looked at the mother for a translation of
these words.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She is two years, going on three,” laughed little Mrs.
Ingle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Force continued her catechism of the child, who
answered in broken baby language, but with rare intelligence,
and still with such simple reverence and admiration
as touched the lady’s heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Natalie!” she said, “can there be anything more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>spirit-searching to a grown-up sinner than the innocent
reverence and trust of a child! Lo! they think us so
wise and so good, while we know ourselves to be so foolish
and evil! Ah me, Natalie!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Young Mrs. Ingle made no reply, but looked puzzled
and distressed while little Essie put up her hand timidly—reverentially,
and stroked the fair cheek of the
lady, with some vague instinct of tenderness and sympathy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, mamma, look at little Wynnie! sweet, little
Wynnie! You have not noticed her yet!” said Elva,
reproachfully, as she arose, and brought the infant to
her mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wynnie?” inquired Mrs. Force, looking up into
Natalie Ingle’s face, as she sat Essie on the carpet and
took the babe on her lap.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, we have named her Wynnette, and we call her
Wynnie. She is not christened yet. We waited for you
to come home,” Natalie explained.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were interrupted by other visitors.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Rev. Dr. Peters and Mrs. Peters came to welcome
their old friends to the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Three years and three months since you left the
neighborhood, madam,” said the rector, when the first
greetings were over. “And dear, dear, what changes
three years have made! Your two younger daughters
have grown so much! Wynnette is a young lady. Elva
soon will be one. And Odalite, madam? I hope she is
well.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Odalite is quite well, thank you, Dr. Peters. She
has gone over to Greenbushes, but she will be back to
dinner. You and Mrs. Peters, I hope, will give us the
happiness of your company for the day,” said the lady.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you, very much; but on this first day after
your return home——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, doctor, I will take no denial. Wynnette, my
love, go and tell Jacob to put up the doctor’s carriage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>and horse. Mrs. Peters, will you lay off your bonnet
here, or will you go to a room?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will go upstairs, if you please, dear. You see I
have my cap in this little bandbox,” replied the rector’s
wife.</p>

<p class='c008'>So they had come to stay! And, of course, Mrs.
Force knew that well enough when she invited them.</p>

<p class='c008'>An old couple, like the good rector and his wife, could
not be expected to come so long a drive only to make a
short call.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Force conducted her latest guest upstairs to a
spare room, where the old lady took off her black Canton
crape shawl, and her black silk bonnet, and put on
her lace cap with white satin ribbons.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then they went down together.</p>

<p class='c008'>When they returned to the drawing room they found
the place deserted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette had carried off young Mrs. Ingle and the
two babies to her own and Elva’s room, which was now
converted into a day nursery, where Natalie, seated in
a low rocking-chair, was putting her baby to sleep, while
Elva, with a picture book, was quietly amusing Essie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, Natty, dear, as you know you are quite at
home, you must excuse me, and let me go down to Dr.
Peters, who is alone in the drawing room,” said Wynnette,
as she kissed her ex-governess and dear friend and
left the chamber.</p>

<p class='c008'>But when she reached the hall below she found that
the good rector was well taken care of.</p>

<p class='c008'>Through the open hall door she saw him and her
father walking up and down the piazza, enjoying the fine
spring day, and smoking some of the squire’s fine cigars.</p>

<p class='c008'>So Wynnette went into the drawing room, where she
found her mother and the rector’s wife, who had just
entered the place.</p>

<p class='c008'>More visitors.</p>

<p class='c008'>The gallop and halt of a horse was heard without, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>soon after Mr. Sam Grandiere, escorted by Mr. Force
and Dr. Peters, entered the drawing room, and made
his bow to the lady of the house and her guest, and then
shook hands with Wynnette and sat down, looking as
red-headed, freckle-faced, bashful and awkward as ever.</p>

<p class='c008'>He remarked that it was a fine day, though bad for
the wheat crop, which wanted rain; and then he hoped
that Mrs. Force and the young ladies felt rested after
their journey.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Force thanked him, and replied that the whole
family were quite recovered from any little fatigue they
might have felt.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rector, to help the bashful young fellow out, inquired
how he had enjoyed his trip to Washington, and
what he thought of the city.</p>

<p class='c008'>Young Sam was not to be “improved” in that way.
He made a characteristic reply. Ignoring every object
of interest within the city’s bounds, he answered that he
thought the land about Washington very poor indeed,
and very badly farmed, and crops looked very unpromising.
He thought the soil had been too hard worked,
and too little manured, and that it wanted rest and food,
so to speak.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But the city, my dear boy, the city! What do you
think of the city, the great capital of a great nation?”
persisted the minister.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The city!” Well, Mr. Sam Grandiere didn’t think
much of the city. There didn’t seem to be much downright,
solid, earnest business going on there, like there
was in Baltimore; and, for his part, he didn’t see how
the people lived, except such as were in the service of
the government. No, bad as the country was round
about Washington, the city was even worse—even less
productive.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rector took up cudgels in defense of the national
seat of government; spoke of the public buildings—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>capitol, the departments, the patent office, the navy yard—and
so on.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Mr. Sam Grandiere could not see any profit or
“produce” in any of them.</p>

<p class='c008'>So the rector gave him over to a reprobate spirit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently Mrs. Ingle—having left both her babies
asleep upstairs, with Elva lovingly watching over them—came
down into the drawing room and greeted the
minister and his wife, and also Mr. Force, whom she had
not earlier seen.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have grown plumper and rosier in the last three
years, my dear. I should scarcely recognize in you the
pale, delicate young bride whom I gave away to the
worthy doctor. Ah! I see how it is! He has enforced
the laws of health,” said the squire, as he warmly shook
her hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes; that is it,” replied Natalie. “He makes my
life a burden to me with <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</span></i> and hygiene.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At this moment Le and Odalite walked into the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le shook hands with the rector and his wife, while
Odalite literally threw herself into the arms of Natalie.</p>

<p class='c008'>And a few minutes later, when she had greeted all
her parents’ guests, she went upstairs with young Mrs.
Ingle to feast her eyes on the sleeping babies over which
Elva was proudly and tenderly watching.</p>

<p class='c008'>There the two friends sat down and had a good, long
talk—all about the young doctor’s prospects, the young
couple’s home, the neighbors, and so forth; but not once
did they speak of Odalite’s trials. Odalite herself never
alluded to the subject, nor did Natalie dare to do so.</p>

<p class='c008'>And it may here be said that the reticence which was
observed in the seclusion of the bedchamber was practiced
in the social circle of the drawing room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Force mentioned the subject of
their family troubles, nor could their guests venture to
do so.</p>

<p class='c008'>Elfrida dreaded the indiscreet tongue of the lady
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>from Wild Cats’; so she was greatly relieved, when she
went out to caution Mrs. Anglesea, to hear that honest
woman say:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let’s try to be jolly this one day, and forget all about
my rascal and our troubles! ’Deed, do you know I have
told everybody in this county how he treated me, so
that they all know it as well as their a b c? And that’s
a rhyme come out of time. I didn’t intend it, but I can’t
mend it. I say! hold on here! there is something the
matter with my headpiece! I never composed no poetry
before and didn’t mean to do it now! It come out so
itself! But you needn’t be afeard of me talking about
Skallawag Anglesea! I’m sick to death of the name of
him!” concluded the lady from the mines.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Force then turned to receive young Dr. Ingle,
who had just driven up in his gig and was now entering
the front door, while old Jake took his equipage around
to the stables.</p>

<p class='c008'>Half an hour later dinner was served. And, in spite
of all drawbacks, it proved a happy reunion of old
friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>After dinner the carriages were ordered, and the visitors
departed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXVI<br /> <span class='large'>LE’S DEPARTURE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>One day Le spent in going around the neighborhood
to see the old friends and neighbors, whom he had not
seen for more than three years. The next day he stayed
home at Mondreer, and spent nearly the whole of it in
company of Odalite.</p>

<p class='c008'>At night the squire drove him to the railway station,
accompanied by Odalite, Wynnette and Elva, as once
before. Also, Le was permitted to sit on the back seat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>beside Odalite, and when there he held her hand in his
as on the previous occasion.</p>

<p class='c008'>They reached the railway station in such good time
that they had about fifteen minutes to wait in the little
sitting room; and there the last adieus were made, when
the train came in.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is not for a three years’ absence at sea this time,
my dear! It is scarcely for three weeks. Before the
middle of May I shall be with you again—please
Heaven,” said Le, as he pressed Odalite to his heart in a
last embrace, before he jumped into the car to be whirled
out of sight.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force with his daughters waited until the sound
of the rushing train died away in the distance, and then
took them back to the carriage and drove homeward.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again, as before, they reached home about ten o’clock,
to find Mrs. Force and the lady from the diggings waiting
up for them—only on this occasion they were not
sitting over a blazing hickory wood fire, in the dead of
winter and night, with a jug of mulled wine steaming on
the hearth; but they were sitting on the front piazza, on
a fine spring evening, with a little table, on which was
arranged a pitcher of iced sherbet, with glasses and a
plate of wafer cakes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, he went off gay and happy as a lark, and we
have come home chirp and merry as grigs!” said Wynnette,
as she tore off and threw down her straw hat and
seated herself at the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I hope he will have a pleasant journey and a
good time altogether! He can’t fail to get all the evidence
he wants, ’cause it’s right there, you know! And
I give him a letter to Joe Mullins, at Wild Cats’, as one
of the witnesses to the marriage, though he wasn’t asked
to sign the register! How should he, when he couldn’t
read? I hope he’ll have time to run out to Wild Cats’
to see Joe! Though, come to think of it, I don’t know
as he’ll find anything there but dark shafts and empty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>shanties. The leads was running out, and the boys was
talking of leaving when I came away. Ah! I hope he
will find some of the poor, dear boys! I should love to
hear from them direct, once more.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How far is Wild Cats’ from St. Sebastian, Mrs.
Anglesea?” rather anxiously inquired Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, only a step—le’s see, now; ’bout a hundred
and seventy-seven miles, I think they said it was.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is there a railroad?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A what? A railroad? Oh, Lord! Why, child,
when I was out there, which was less than four years
ago, there was not even a turnpike road within a hundred
miles of it. There’s a trail, though!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean by a trail?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I mean a mule track.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I do not think that Le can go there. It must
be a long and tedious journey, and he will not have
time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes he will! And opportunity also. There’ll
be mule trains, you know. He can pack on one of them.
He can rough it! You bet! He’s every inch a man, is
Le Force!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He must not risk losing his passage on our steamer,”
said Odalite.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do not be anxious, my dear; he will not run any
risks of losing the steamer. I think, also, that he will
have time to do our friend’s commission. There has
been a road made over that section since Mrs. Anglesea
left it. And, now I think, we had better go indoors.
The night air is too cold to remain out longer.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They went into the house and soon after retired to
bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The days that followed Le’s departure were active,
cheerful, full of life.</p>

<p class='c008'>The old friends and neighbors of the Forces received
them back into their midst with not only the earnest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>love of time-honored friendship, but with the distinction
due to illustrious visitors.</p>

<p class='c008'>They called on them promptly.</p>

<p class='c008'>They got up dinner and tea parties for their entertainment.</p>

<p class='c008'>They would have nominated Mr. Force as their representative
in Congress for the ensuing year, but that he
was going abroad with his family for a year.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Forces entered heartily into all the schemes of
pleasure and hospitality set on foot in the community.</p>

<p class='c008'>They accepted all the invitations given to them, and
in return they gave dinner and tea parties until they
had also entertained all their friends and neighbors.</p>

<p class='c008'>And so the last weeks of April passed and May was
on hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Letters from Le came by every Californian mail.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had reached St. Sebastian; he had found the Rev.
Father Minitree; he had searched the parish register;
found the marriage between Angus Anglesea and Ann
Maria Wright duly recorded, signed and witnessed; he
had hunted out the living witnesses, and he had procured
attested copies of the marriage record, further
indorsed by the written and sworn statements of the
officiating priest and of the surviving witnesses. And
so, with evidence as strong as evidence could be, he
wrote that he was ready to come home, only that he
wished to oblige Mrs. Anglesea by going out to Wild
Cats’ Gulch to inquire after her boys. The journey
there and back, he thought, might occupy him four days.
After that he should start for home, which he hoped to
reach about the fifteenth of May.</p>

<p class='c008'>Letters also came from the Earl of Enderby in answer
to Mrs. Force’s missive that had announced the time of
the family’s sailing for Europe—letters saying that the
very near prospect and the anticipation of seeing his
dear and only sister and her children had made him feel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>so much better in spirits that his health had improved
under it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the most constant visitors at Mondreer was
Mr. Sam Grandiere, whose visits could not be mistaken
as to their meaning, and whose attentions to Wynnette
on all occasions of their meetings in other companies had
attracted the observation of the whole neighborhood and
caused much talk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Force is such a practical sort of man that so
long as he knows young Grandiere comes of a good old
Maryland family, and that his character is beyond reproach,
he will not mind his roughness of manner or
plainness of speech, or his want of a collegiate education,
or refuse him his daughter on that account,” said young
Dr. Ingle to his wife one evening when they were talking
over the affair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, perhaps not; but how could our brilliant Wynnette
ever fancy such a lout!” exclaimed Natalie, indignantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, indeed, you are too severe on the poor fellow!
And you, coming from the North, do not understand
our Maryland ways. In your State it is the farmers’
boys who are sent to school and college in preference
to the girls, if any are to go; but in Maryland it is
always the farmers’ girls who are put to boarding school
in preference to the boys; as in your State you find
learned statesmen, lawyers and clergymen belonging to
families of very plainly educated women, so in our
State you will find refined and accomplished women in
the same families with very plain, simply schooled men.
It is queer, but it is so. Our Maryland men will make
any sacrifice, even that of their own mental culture, in
order to educate their women, and I think in that they
show the very spirit of generosity.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But among all the people who observed and criticized
the growing intimacy between Wynnette and young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Grandiere, none was more interested than quaint little
Rosemary Hedge.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rosemary was poetic, romantic and sentimental to a
degree. She was devoted to Wynnette and Elva Force;
and she could not bear the idea of Wynnette “throwing
herself away” on such a rustic.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is my own dear cousin, Wynnette, and I love him
dearly as a cousin; but, indeed, I could not marry him to
save my soul! And though he is a good boy, I do not
think he is a proper match for you,” said Rosemary, one
morning, when she had come to spend the day at Mondreer,
and the two girls were <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i> in Wynnette’s
room, where she had taken her visitor to lay off her
bonnet.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not?” curtly demanded Wynnette, who did not
like these criticisms upon her lover.</p>

<p class='c008'>But worse was to come.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not?” echoed Rosemary. “Why, because
dear Sam is so rough and ungainly. He has red hair
and a freckled face——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So has the Duke of Argyll and all the princely
Campbells!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And he has a club nose!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So have I. ‘Pot can’t call kettle black.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And such big hands and feet——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So much the better for useful work.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, oh! Wynnette, he—he——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What now?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He has no education to speak of—nothing but a common-school
education!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Like any number of our great men who have risen
to high rank, wealth and fame in the army, navy, civil
service, or learned professions.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, but he’ll never rise above his station. He hasn’t
intellect enough.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Neither had any of the grand, brave, simple heroes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>and warriors of old whose deeds stir our hearts, even
now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, Wynnette, Sam Grandiere is nothing like that!
He would not even understand you if you were to talk
to him as you do to me. His thoughts run all on crops
and cattle and——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whatever is really useful and beneficial to his folks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In meeting their material wants only, Wynnette.
But it is vain to argue with you. If you are determined
to throw yourself away on Sam Grandiere——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, Rosemary, stow that, or the fat will be in the
fire!” exclaimed the girl, flushing with a blaze of short-lived
anger. “I mean I cannot bear to hear you depreciate
the excellence of Samuel Grandiere. He is honest,
true, and tender. He is as brave as a lion, and as magnanimous
as a king—ought to be!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I know, but——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And where would you find such a lineage in the
State as his?” vehemently interrupted Wynnette. “His
pedigree can be traced back, step by step, to the Sieur
Louis de Grandiere, who came over to England in the
year 1420, in the suit of Katherine of Valois, queen of
Henry the Fifth; though, of course, that tells but little.
He was probably a gentleman in waiting, though he
might have been a horse boy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He was a gentleman in waiting on the queen. He
was a nobleman of Provence,” replied quaint little Rosemary,
craning her neck in defense of her ancestor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, he was! Well, I always thought so! But that
is more than can be said of Mr. Roland Bayard!” said
Wynnette, maliciously.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rosemary flushed to the edges of her curly black hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do not know what he has to do with the question,”
she murmured.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Only this, my love: that while we are taking sweet
counsel together, and you are giving me the benefit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>your wisdom in regard to Mr. Samuel Elk Grandiere,
I might reciprocate by giving you a friendly warning
in respect to Mr. Roland Bayard!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Wynnette!” cried Rosemary, deprecatingly,
while the color deepened all over her face and neck.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nobody knows who he is! He was washed ashore
from the wreck of the <em>Carrier Pigeon</em>, the only one
saved. He was adopted by Miss Sibby, good soul, and
he was educated at the expense of Mr. Force, generous
man! Why, he was not only homeless, friendless and
penniless, but he was nameless until the name of Roland
Bayard was given him by Mr. Force and Miss
Sibby, who were his sponsors in baptism!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! oh! Wynnette! No one can look at Roland
Bayard without seeing that he must be of princely
lineage! He is very handsome, and graceful and accomplished!
He is refined, cultured, intellectual!” pleaded
Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t see it! He has been through college and he
has plenty of modest assurance, which prevents him from
being bashful and awkward, as some of his betters are.
But all the same, he is nobody’s son!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Wynnette! that is not generous of you! Can
dear—can Roland help his misfortune? Is he to blame
for being wrecked on our shore in his infancy, and losing
everything, even his name? Oh, Wynnette!” said
Rosemary, with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No! I am not generous! I am a little catamount,
and worse than that! It is not true, either, what I said
about him! Roland is a fine fellow. And of course he
must have been somebody’s son! Don’t cry, Rosie. I
didn’t mean it, dear! Only the devil does get in me
sometimes!” said the generous girl, stooping and kissing
her quaint little friend.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rosemary smiled through her tears; and then they
went downstairs together.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>And as this was the first, so it was the last time that
the subject in dispute was mentioned between the two
girls.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXVII<br /> <span class='large'>LUCE’S DISCOVERY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As Wynnette and Rosemary approached the drawing
room they heard a sweet confusion of laughing and
talking within; which was explained as soon as Wynnette
had opened the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le had just arrived, and was in the midst of his
friends shaking hands, hugging and kissing, asking and
answering questions, all at once.</p>

<p class='c008'>He rushed to Wynnette and Rosemary “at sight,” and
gave them each a hearty, brotherly embrace.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” he continued, with something that he had been
saying when the girls came in—“yes, I have brought all
the evidence we can possibly want or use—an overwhelming
mass of evidence as to the marriage of Angus
Anglesea and Ann Maria Wright at St. Sebastian, on
August 1, 18—. That is proved and established beyond
all doubt or question.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“As if anybody ever did doubt it. The Lord knows
if ever I had thought as any of you misdoubted as I was
Anglesea’s lawful wedded wife, I wouldn’t a-stayed in
this house one hour. Not I!” indignantly protested Mrs.
Anglesea.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No one ever did or ever could doubt that fact, my
good lady,” said Mr. Force, soothingly; “but there are
captious people who will contest things that they cannot
doubt. And it is to meet such as these that we must be
armed with overwhelming evidence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Anglesea was mollified, and presently inquired
if Le had seen her boys.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“I did not go to Wild Cats’ Gulch, dear Mrs. Anglesea,”
replied Le.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Didn’t go!’ But you wrote as you was a-going!”
exclaimed the lady from that section.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and so I was. But on the very day when I proposed
to start thither, on inquiring the best way to get
there, I was referred to a man who was said to have once
lived at the place. So I went, and found the referee to
be a Mr. Joe Mullins, in the jewelry line of business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Joe Mullins! My Joe! He in St. Sebastian! Do
tell me now!” exclaimed Mrs. Anglesea.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, there he was, healthy, happy and prosperous,
keeping a jeweler’s store, and living over it with his wife
and two children!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lord a mercy! Married, too!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and prosperous.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, well! And the other boys?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Le looked solemn.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Some gone east;</div>
      <div class='line'>Some gone west;</div>
      <div class='line'>And some rest</div>
      <div class='line'>At Crow’s Nest,’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>ruefully answered the young man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And the camp’s broke up, as I thought it would be.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, two years ago.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, it is some satisfaction to hear about Joe. And
so now I won’t interrupt of you no longer, as I dessay
you have a heap to talk about among your ownselves,”
said Mrs. Anglesea, as she left the drawing room.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as she was gone the family fell into more
confidential conversation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We shall sail for England in ten days,” said Mr.
Force, “and with this complete evidence of the Californian
marriage in our possession we will, on our arrival
in the old country, seek out authentic evidence of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>exact date of Lady Mary Anglesea’s demise, which I
fully believe to have occurred in the August of some
year previous to that of Col. Anglesea’s marriage with
the Widow Wright. When we shall find such evidence,
as I feel sure we shall, then there will be nothing wanting
to prove that Ann Maria Anglesea is the lawful wife
of Angus Anglesea, and that Odalite Force is, and has
always been, free, and there need be nothing to prevent
your immediate union, my dear children.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“May Heaven speed the day!” earnestly aspirated Le.</p>

<p class='c008'>Much more was said on the subject that need not be
repeated here.</p>

<p class='c008'>Preparations for their voyage had been so long and
systematically in progress that the Forces had perfect
leisure in the last week of their stay at home.</p>

<p class='c008'>The last day was devoted to the friends they were
about to leave behind.</p>

<p class='c008'>They started early on the morning of the twenty-third
of May, and made a round of farewell visits to all
their old neighbors.</p>

<p class='c008'>The last call they made was at Forest Rest, to take
leave of Miss Sibby Bayard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So you are ralely a-going to cross the high seas? I
hardly believed it on you, Abel Force!” she said, as she
shook hands in turn with Mr. and Mrs. Force, Le and
the three girls, and gave them seats. “I thought as you
had more sense, Abel Force! I did that! Them as has
the least to do with the sea, sez I, comes the best off,
sez I!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, my good lady, necessity has no law, you know.
We are obliged to go,” laughed Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What have you been up and doing of, old Abel, that
you are obliged to run away from your own native country?
Nobody but outlaws, sez I, is obliged to go off to
furrin parts, sez I!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force found nothing to say to this.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette came to her father’s assistance.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>“We shall visit, among other interesting places, Arundel
Castle, the seat of your ancestors for centuries past,
Miss Sibby.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush, honey! You don’t say as you’ll go there?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“As sure as the Lord permits us, we will, Miss Sibby.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And see it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and see it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“With your own eyes?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, no,” gravely replied Wynnette, “not with our
own eyes, because we might have to stretch them too
wide to take in a view of the great stronghold of the
great ducal house. We propose to hire some stout, able-bodied
eyes for the occasion!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now you are laughing at me, Miss Wynnette!
You are always laughing heartiest inside when you’re a
looking solemnest outside! But you ralely are gwine to
visit ’Rundel Cassil?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. All tourists go there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, well, well! Them as lives the longest, sez I,
sees the most, sez I. But little did I think as I should
live to see any of my neighbors going to visit ’Rundel
Cassil!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We will bring you a guidebook with illustrations, descriptive
of the castle, and some relics and curiosities of
the place. They are to be had, I think.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do, my child! I should prize ’em above everything.
And now, Miss Wynnette, you take a ole ’oman’s advice.
Them as follows my advice, sez I, never comes to no
harm, sez I. Mind that, honey.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, Miss Sibby; fire away!—I mean proceed
with your good counsel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, then, honey, I ain’t been that blind but I could
see what was a-goin’ on between a certain young gentleman
and a certain young lady.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette tacitly pleaded guilty by a deep blush.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, honey, don’t you take it anyways amiss what I
am a-gwine to say. You’re gwine off to furrin parts.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Now, honey, don’t you let any of them there furrin
colonels and counts and things fashionate you away from
you own dear sweetheart. He’s a good, true man, is
Sam Grandiere, and a ole neighbor’s son. Now you take
my advice and be true to him, as he is sure to be true to
you. Them as breaks faith, sez I, is sure to pay for it,
sez I. There, now, I won’t say no more. When you’ve
said all you’ve got to say, sez I, it is time to stop, sez I.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Force now arose to take leave.</p>

<p class='c008'>All her party kissed Miss Sibby good-by.</p>

<p class='c008'>The old lady cried a little, and prayed: “God bless
them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And so they parted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Early the next morning the Forces left Mondreer,
taking the dog, Joshua, with them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette had insisted on his coming.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I promised him, papa,” she said—“I promised him;
and it would be playing it too low to go back on a dumb
brute—oh! I mean, dear papa, that it would seem base
to break faith with a poor, confiding dog.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So Joshua went.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look yere, ole woman,” said the lady from Wild
Cats’, “I’m gwine to take the best of care of your house
while you’re gone, and I want you to keep an eye on my
rascal over yonder, while I keep a sharp lookout for him
over here. He can’t be in both places at once; but
wherever he is he will be at some deviltry—you may bet
your pile on that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This was the lady’s last good-by to the departing
family.</p>

<p class='c008'>She watched the procession of three carriages that
took them and all their luggage to the railway station,
where Rosemary Hedge was to be brought by her
mother and aunt to join them.</p>

<p class='c008'>She watched them cross the lawn, and go out through
the north gate, and disappear up the wooded road.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>And then she turned into the house to face the howling
Luce.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What on earth ails the woman?” demanded the
housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! dey’s gone ag’in!—dey’s gone ag’in! An’ dis
time dey’s gone across de ocean! I shall nebber see ’em
ag’in!—nebber no mo’!—nebber no mo’!” sobbed Lucy,
sitting flat on the hall floor, and rocking her body back
and forth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes you will. Don’t be a fool! Get up and go
to work. Work’s the best cure for trouble. Indeed,
work’s the best cure for most things—poverty, for instance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It didn’t use to be so! It didn’t use to be so!” said
Luce, continuing to rock herself. “Dey nebber use to go
’way from year’s end to year’s end! But now it’s got
to be a habit dey gibs deirselbes—a berry habit dey gibs
deirselbes!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /> <span class='large'>FORBIDDEN LOVE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The three carriages conveying the large party from
the old manor house rolled on through the familiar
woods, so often traversed by the young people of the
household in going to and fro between Mondreer and
Greenbushes.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the foremost carriage rode Mr. and Mrs. Force,
Wynnette and Elva.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the second, Odalite and Le.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the third, Dickon and Gipsy, the valet and lady’s
maid, in charge of all the lighter luggage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Joshua, the dog, raced on before in the highest state
of ecstasy, but occasionally raced back again, as if to
be sure that his large family were following him safely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>without disappearing in the woods to the right or the
left.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force knew perfectly well that that dog was
going to give him more trouble and embarrassment on
land and sea than all his party twice told; that it would
be the unfailing cause of rows and rumpuses, on trains
and boats, and that might end in Joshua being cast off,
or lost, or killed.</p>

<p class='c008'>But what could he do?</p>

<p class='c008'>Talk of your henpecked husband, indeed! He is not
half so common, or half so helpless, as your chickpecked
father.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette had promised Joshua that he should never
be left behind again, and she said that it would be base
to deceive and betray a poor dog. Wynnette said the
dog must come, and he came.</p>

<p class='c008'>When they came in sight of Chincapin Creek little
Elva put her head out of the window and gazed, and
continued to gaze, fondly, if silently, on the spot so full
of pleasant, childish memories, until they had crossed
the bridge, and left the place behind. Then, with a little,
involuntary sigh, she drew in her head and sat back in
her seat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette mocked her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why don’t you say, ‘Adieu, blest scenes of my innocent
infancy! Virtue and simplicity,’ and so on and
so on!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Wynnette! How can you?” exclaimed Elva,
almost in tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t! I never could! It isn’t in my line! But
why don’t you?” mocked the girl, raising her black eyebrows.</p>

<p class='c008'>They reached the station in full time, and had twenty
minutes to wait. Mr. Force had engaged a whole compartment
for his party by telegraph the day before.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the waiting room they found all the Grandieres,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>all the Elks, and little Rosemary Hedge, with her luggage.</p>

<p class='c008'>There followed an animating scene—a little laughing,
more crying and much talking.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Hedge implored Mrs. Force to be a mother to
her fatherless child, and to bring her back safe and well
at the end of the year.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Force promised all that a woman could, under
the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c008'>And Roland Bayard, who sat beside little Rosemary
holding her hand in his, spoke up and said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dear Mrs. Hedge, don’t grieve about the little
maiden. If, at any time, you should be pining to have
her back, you can let me know and I will just run over
and fetch her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was something very comforting in this promise,
because Mrs. Hedge knew that Roland Bayard meant
what he said; and very cheering in the manner in which
he put it—“Just run over and fetch her!” Why, it
sounded like such a mere trifle to cross the ocean, in
these days of steam. But Roland was still talking.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And, Rosemary, if you get homesick before our
friends are ready to return, write to me, darling, and
I’ll come and fetch you back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Mr. Bayard! you don’t know how you have consoled
me!” said Mrs. Hedge, wiping her eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will write to you every week, Roland. And I will
keep a journal for you, and send it in monthly parts, so
that you may seem to be traveling with us! Oh, how I
wish you were!” sighed Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you, darling? Well, perhaps you may see me
sooner than you expect,” replied Roland, mysteriously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! oh! will you be coming over? Does the <em>Kitty</em>
ever go to England?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know, dear; but if the <em>Kitty</em> don’t, there will
be one or two other little craft crossing—perhaps. Let
us live in hope.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>While Rosemary and Roland chatted together, Mrs.
Hedge turned to Mrs. Force, saying:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you happy woman! You are going to Europe
with all you love at your side—husband, children and
nephew! While I stay home, widowed, practically
childless and alone! Talk of the compensations of life!
There is no compensation in mine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘The heart knoweth its own bitterness!’” murmured
Elfrida Force to herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mother! Mother! I won’t go! I won’t leave you!”
cried Rosemary, jumping up and throwing herself into
the widow’s arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush, my child, hush! I wish you to go, and you
must do so. It is for your own profit and instruction,”
replied Mrs. Hedge.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then, my own dear mother, won’t you just think
that I have only gone back to school in Washington, and
that I shall be home as usual to spend the Christmas
holidays? Mr. Force expects to bring us all home in
December.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, yes, I shall be comforted, child,” replied the
widow, and she held her daughter on her lap, against
her bosom, with Rosemary’s arms clasped around her
neck, until they heard the sound of the approaching
train.</p>

<p class='c008'>The train never stopped longer than three minutes at
this station.</p>

<p class='c008'>All arose to bid their last good-bys.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the rest, Joshua came out from behind Wynnette’s
skirts, and shook himself, and very nearly shook
the building. All alert was he to see that his eccentric
family did not escape him again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gracious goodness, Mr. Force! Here is that dog
followed you all the way from Mondreer! What’s to be
done with him? Shall I take him home? Will he follow
me?” inquired Sam Grandiere, eager to be useful.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is to go abroad with us,” groaned the squire, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>was hastily shaking hands right and left with the friends
who had come to see him and his family off.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But will they allow——”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no time to finish his question, for—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-by, Sam,” said Wynnette, holding out her
hand. “Remember the advice I gave you about taking
a course at Charlotte Hall College.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will, Wynnette, I will!” earnestly answered the
young fellow, with tears brimming in his honest blue
eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will write to me as often as you can, and I will
answer every one of your letters. And—listen here,
Sam,” she added, in a whisper that the long-legged boy
had to stoop to catch, “I won’t marry a royal duke if I
can resist the temptation! Good-by.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole party hurried out of the building to the
platform, where the train had just stopped, with its
puffing and blowing engine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force showed his tickets, and the party were conducted
to their car. In the confusion of a final leave-taking,
then and there, between two such large parties,
Joshua, who did not at all like the looks of things in
general, with the long train of cars, the panting engine,
the steam, the smoke, the crowd, the baggage heavers, the
excitement, and the general “hullabuloo,” and who
feared that he might lose sight of his family in this
crash of worlds, managed to slip into the car, between
Wynnette’s duster and Gipsy’s arms full of shawls, and
to ensconce himself under the broad lounge in the compartment.</p>

<p class='c008'>The last kisses were given, the last “God bless you”
spoken, and the travelers were seated in their compartment
not ten seconds before the train started.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now!” exclaimed Wynnette, triumphantly. “Have
we had the least trouble with Joshua?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not yet,” curtly replied her father. “Where is he?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“Under the sofa—and Rosemary, Elva and myself,
by sitting here, hide him from view.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well. Keep him quiet, if you can.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The train was rushing on at express speed, when the
conductor came along to collect the tickets. He entered
their compartment. Joshua considered his appearance
an unwarrantable intrusion, and told him so in a low,
thunderous growl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s that?” suddenly demanded the conductor,
looking around.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Urr-rr-rr-rr,” remarked Joshua.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is a valuable dog of ours. I am quite willing to
pay his fare,” replied Mr. Force, taking out his pocketbook.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He can’t be allowed in the passenger car, sir,” replied
the conductor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not in the compartment that we have taken for our
own convenience, and where he cannot possibly annoy
anybody else?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, sir; it is against the rules.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Mr. Conductor! please! please! He is such a
good dog, and we love him so much! Indeed, he will
not bite when he knows you don’t mean to hurt us!
Please, Mr. Conductor, let him stay!” pleaded Elva.</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Gainst the rules, miss. Very sorry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Papa, tip that fellow with a V, and stop this row!—I
mean, papa, pray offer this officer the consideration of
a five-dollar note, and conclude this controversy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Of course, it was Wynnette who uttered this insolence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush, my dear, hush! This is quite inadmissible.
The conductor must do his duty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If he gets put off the train I’ll go, too! He’ll never
find his way home!” said Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>Elva began to cry.</p>

<p class='c008'>The conductor was in a hurry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If this young gentleman will bring the dog after me
to the freight car, the baggage master will take charge of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>him for a trifle,” suggested the conductor, who was more
moved to pity by Elva’s tears than to anger by Wynnette’s
insolence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go, Le,” said Mr. Force, opening his pocketbook and
taking from it a note, which he put into the midshipman’s
hands. “Give this to the man, and tell him if he
will take care of the dog he shall have another at the
end of this journey.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And introduce Joshua to the baggage master, and
tell him what a cultivated and gentlemanly dog he is!
And don’t you leave them together until you are sure
that they are good friends! Do you hear me, Leonidas
Force?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, Wynnette,” said good-humored Le, taking
Joshua by the collar and trying to pull him from under
the sofa.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the dog declined to leave his retreat. He did
not recognize Mr. Midshipman Force as his master.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bother! I shall have to take him myself. You can
come with us if you like, Le; but you needn’t if you
don’t,” said Wynnette. And she whistled for the dog,
who immediately came out and put his gray paws upon
her lap.</p>

<p class='c008'>She arose and called him to follow her. Le and the
conductor escorted her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know we are going to have no end of trouble with
that dog,” said Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I think not, when we learn how to manage. We
must always give him in charge of the baggage master
at the start,” replied Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette and Le were gone nearly an hour. At last
they returned.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What kept you so long? Did the dog prove intractable,
or the baggage master unaccommodating?” inquired
Odalite of Le.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not at all!” exclaimed Wynnette, answering for her
companion. “That baggage man’s a good sort. He and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Joshua became pals at once. He loves dogs, and dogs
love him. As soon as ever I presented Joshua to him
he held out his hand, and said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Hello, old pard! how are you? Shall we be pals?’
or words to that effect. And said Joshua slapped his
paw into the open palm, and—</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘It’s a whack!’ or barks to the same purpose.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But what kept you so long? What were you doing
all that time?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Talking to the baggage master. I do like to talk to
real men much better than to the curled and scented
la-da-da things we meet in society. His name is Kirby.
He came from Lancashire, England, where he has an old
father living, to whom he sends a part of his wages every
month. He is forty-five years old, and has been married
twenty years, and has eleven children, the oldest eighteen
and the youngest one. I told him we were going
to Lancashire, and would take anything he might like
to send to his dad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, my dear, Lancashire is a large county, and we
may not be anywhere near his native place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We could make a point of going there to oblige such
a man as he is, papa. Think of his bringing up a large
family and helping his old father, too, on such small
wages as he must get. Oh, he is a downright real man.
And, indeed, I have a warm place in my heart for real
men.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is why you like Sa——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shut up, Rosemary!”</p>

<p class='c008'>And Rosemary obeyed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The remainder of the journey was made without disturbance.</p>

<p class='c008'>They reached Washington about 3 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, dined and
rested for an hour at their favorite hotel, and took the
afternoon train to New York, where they arrived very
late at night.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>They had no more trouble with the dog, now that they
knew how to manage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force went down to the steamer to see about the
passage of the animal, and found that there was a place
in the steerage of the great ship where the creature could
be accommodated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ah, what a chickpecked father that man was!</p>

<p class='c008'>“If they had wanted to fetch a favorite cow, I should
have been obliged to bring her somehow,” he said to
himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the next morning Mr. Force took his family to
Central Park and to the menagerie.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the evening he took them to the opera to hear Kellogg.
That was their last night in the city.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIX<br /> <span class='large'>“ONCE MORE UPON THE WATERS”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Saturday, the twenty-eighth of May, was a very fine
day. As early as seven in the morning the hacks engaged
to take our travelers to the steamer were standing
before the ladies’ entrance of the Metropolitan Hotel.</p>

<p class='c008'>Their luggage had been sent aboard ship on the day
before.</p>

<p class='c008'>A little after seven the whole party came down and
entered the carriages, and were driven off toward the
pier where the <em>Persia</em> lay.</p>

<p class='c008'>They arrived amid the bustle and confusion that always
attends the sailing of an ocean steamer—crowds
of carriages and drags of all sorts; crowds of men,
women and children of all sorts; crowds of passengers
going on; crowds of friends seeing them off; here and
there a heartrending parting; a bedlam of sights; a
babel of sounds, deafening noises, suffocating scents.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Such was the scene on the pier and such was the scene
on the deck when Mr. Force had succeeded in navigating
his party from the first to the last.</p>

<p class='c008'>“For Heaven’s sake keep close together! Are we all
here?” he anxiously inquired.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All!” answered a score of voices.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where’s that dog?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here, papa. I have him by the collar,” answered
Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Keep hold of him, then. And sit down, all of you,
and be quiet until this crowd leaves the deck. We cannot
attempt to get to our staterooms at present.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His party complied with this order.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All ashore!” called out a voice in authority.</p>

<p class='c008'>The words were magical.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hurried embraces; laughing good-bys; weeping good-bys;
fervent God bless yous; agonized partings; and
then a pressure over the gang plank to the pier.</p>

<p class='c008'>Five minutes later and the valedictory gun was fired,
and the <em>Persia</em> stood out to sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh,” said little Elva, as she observed the sad faces
of some passengers who were leaning over the sides of
the ship and waving handkerchiefs to friends on the pier—“oh,
I am glad we are all going together and have not
left any one behind to cry after—no, not even our dog.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A little later on our passengers sought their staterooms
below. Dickon—than whom no blacker boy ever was
born—took the dog to that part of the ship for such
four-footed passengers made and provided, and then
went to look up his own berth in the second cabin.</p>

<p class='c008'>Never was finer weather, a clearer sky, a calmer sea,
or a swifter voyage than blessed the <em>Persia</em>, which sailed
on that Saturday morning of May 28th.</p>

<p class='c008'>Only those of the most bilious temperaments suffered
from seasickness. None of our party were affected.</p>

<p class='c008'>All the passengers rejoiced at the prosperity of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>voyage—all except Wynnette, who longed to see a storm
at sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was disgusted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I had just as lief travel in a canal boat!” she
growled, when they were about halfway across the Atlantic.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was bound to be disappointed to the last. The
voyage was continued in the finest early summer weather,
until in the dead of a moonlight night the steamer anchored
in the Cove of Cork.</p>

<p class='c008'>Early the next morning all the passengers were out
on deck to see the beautiful bay with its lovely hilly
shores, and its picturesque little port of Queenstown.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ship remained at anchor only long enough to deliver
mails and freight, and then she put to sea again
and headed for the mouth of the Mersey.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette, Elva and Rosemary remained on deck all
day feasting their eyes on the shores of England, the
isles of the channel, and later on the green banks of the
Mersey with its pretty towns and villages, castles and
cottages.</p>

<p class='c008'>Early in the afternoon the ship reached Liverpool.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the bustle of the debarkation and the nuisance
of the custom house was over, and Mr. Force was handing
the ladies of his party into a capacious carriage to
convey them to the Adelphi Hotel, he inquired:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, shall we take rooms there for the night, or
only supper, and leave by the evening express for Cumberland?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, let us go on, if you please! What time does our
train leave?” inquired Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ten-fifty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then we can reach Nethermost, the nearest station
to Enderby Castle, by morning. If you telegraph to
Enderby my brother will send carriages there to meet
us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well,” said Mr. Force, as he shut the carriage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>door and gave the coachman the address to which he
was to drive.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force then sent his two servants with the dog and
the lighter luggage in another conveyance after his family,
while he and Leonidas Force attended to the duty of
having their trunks transferred from the custom house
to the Lime Street Railroad Station.</p>

<p class='c008'>An hour after this the whole family were gathered
around the tea table in their private parlor at the Adelphi.
The dog, stretched on a Russian rug before the
sofa, was making himself at home.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you think of all this, Rosie?” kindly inquired
Mr. Force of little Rosemary Hedge.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—I—feel as if I were reading it all in a novel by
Aunt Sukey’s evening fire at Grove Hill,” replied the
quaint little creature.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you, Elva?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I feel so very much at home, as if I had come
back from somewhere to grandmother’s house. A very
strange, pleasant feeling of old familiarity,” said weird
little Elva.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As for me,” said Wynnette, “I see ghosts!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ghosts!” exclaimed all the company in chorus.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, ghosts! ‘This isle is full of spirits.’ I see
ghosts! All sorts of ghosts! Ghosts of savages in skins!
These must be spirits of the ancient Britons! Ghosts of
men in armor! These must be the medieval knights and
men-at-arms! Ghosts of gentlemen in velvet and satin
tunic and lace collars and pointed shoes! These must
be the courtiers of Queen Elizabeth’s time! And now
come the hideous powdered wigs, broad-bottomed coats,
and long silk stockings of——Say, papa! give me some
of those strawberries, or I shall see his Satanic majesty
presently.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force gravely passed along the cut-glass bowl of
the luscious fruit.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Immediately after supper the travelers left the hotel
for the railway station.</p>

<p class='c008'>There Abel Force engaged a whole compartment for
his family, and took tickets in the second-class carriage
for his two servants.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And how can I carry a valuable dog?” inquired the
squire of the guard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take him in your own compartment, if you like,
sir,” replied that officer, staring a little.</p>

<p class='c008'>Joshua didn’t wait for permission, but jumped into
the carriage after Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>The three other ladies followed. Last of all Abel
Force and Le entered and took their seats, though the
train was not yet quite ready to start.</p>

<p class='c008'>Compartments on English trains differ from those on
our own, in being entirely separated by a solid partition
from other compartments on the same carriage, and they
are thereby quite private for those who engage a whole
one. This compartment taken by the Forces resembled
the inside of a large coach, having eight cushioned seats,
four being in front and four behind.</p>

<p class='c008'>The train started at ten-fifty, and whirled on through
the twilight of the summer night, which in England
never seems to grow quite dark.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the first station at which the train stopped, the
guard came along and put his head into the window.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tickets, please, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force handed over seven tickets for his party.</p>

<p class='c008'>Guard counted them, and touched his hat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dog ticket, please, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?” demanded the astonished squire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dog ticket, please, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dog ticket? I have none. Didn’t know one would
be required. Never heard of such a thing. But I will
pay his fare.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Couldn’t take it, sir. ’Gainst the rules.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>“Then what shall I do?” exclaimed the distressed
squire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle, I will jump out and buy a dog ticket at the
station here,” said Le; and without waiting a second he
sprang from the carriage and vanished into the ticket
office.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look sharp, young gent, or you’ll be left. Train
starts again in two minutes,” called the guard.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le did look sharp, and the next minute reappeared,
flourishing the prize.</p>

<p class='c008'>He jumped in, and the train moved on.</p>

<p class='c008'>Everybody went to sleep except Wynnette, who went
off into a waking dream, and saw the ghosts of all her
ancestors, from the Druids down, pass in procession before
her. A weird, unreal, magical night journey this
seemed to the travelers. The night express stopped at
fewer stations than any other train of the twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whenever it did stop, our passengers waked up and
looked out upon the strange and beautiful land—old, but
always new—dotted with its country towns and villages,
its castles, farmhouses and cottages, dimly seen in the
soft haze of the summer night, where evening and morning
twilight seemed to meet so that it was never dark.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the whole, it was a pleasant, charming journey,
the last few miles being along the rough and rocky coast.
The dawn was reddening in the east, and the northern
morning air felt fresh and invigorating, when the train
stopped at Nethermost, a picturesque little hamlet built
up and down the sides of the cliff wherever there was
room for a sea-bird’s nest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, what a charming place!” exclaimed Rosemary,
looking out upon it. The line of railway ran along
under the cliff, and the little station was built against
the rocks.</p>

<p class='c008'>The guard came and opened the door.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>Mr. Force jumped off, and then handed out the ladies
of his party, one by one.</p>

<p class='c008'>The porters were at the same time throwing off their
luggage.</p>

<p class='c008'>In another minute the train had moved on, and the
travelers were left standing on the platform, with the
sea on the west, the cliffs on the east, and the hamlet
of Nethermost scattered at random on the sides of the
latter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There are the carriages,” said Mr. Force, as he described
three vehicles grouped together at a short distance.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the same time a servant in livery approached,
touched his hat, and respectfully inquired:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Party for Enderby Castle, sir?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” replied Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This way, if you please, sir.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXX<br /> <span class='large'>ENDERBY CASTLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>There were two spacious open barouches and one
large wagon.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My lord ordered me, sir, if the weather should be
fine, to bring the barouches for the ladies, as they would
be so much pleasanter,” the man explained, touching his
hat, as he held the door of the first carriage open for
Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>The travelers were soon seated—Mr. and Mrs. Force,
Wynnette and Elva in the first barouche, Le, Odalite and
Rosemary in the second, and the two servants, with the
dog and the luggage, in the wagon.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, how jolly!” exclaimed Wynnette, looking about
her.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>By this time it was light enough to see their surroundings—the
hoary cliffs and the picturesque fishing
village on their right; the far-spread rocky beach, with
the fishing boats drawn up, on their left; the expanse
of ocean beyond, dotted at long distances with sails; and
right near them the only street of the hamlet that ran
from the beach up through a natural cleft in the rocks,
and looked something like a rude, broad staircase of
flagstones, which were paved on edge to afford a hold
to horses’ feet in climbing up the steep ascent.</p>

<p class='c008'>By this time, too, the denizens of the village were
out before their doors to stare at the unusual sight of
three carriages and a large party of visitors for Enderby
Castle.</p>

<p class='c008'>For, of course, as his lordship’s carriages and liveried
servants were there to meet the party of travelers, they
must be visitors to the castle.</p>

<p class='c008'>The men took off their hats and the women courtesied
as the open carriages passed slowly up the steep street
to the top of the cliff, where it joined the road leading
northward along the sea toward Enderby Castle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now the travelers in the open carriages had a grand
view of land and water.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the east, moorland rolling into hills in the mid distance
and rising into mountains on the far horizon. The
newly risen sun shining above them and tinting all their
tops with the soft and varied hues of the opal stone.
Here and there at long distances could be seen the ruined
tower of some ancient stronghold, or the roof and chimneys
of some old farmstead. Everything looked old or
ancient on this wild coast of Cumberland.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the west the ocean rolled out until lost to view
in the mists of the horizon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before them northward the road stretched for many
a mile.</p>

<p class='c008'>Far ahead they saw a mighty promontory stretching
out to sea. At its base the waves dashed, leaped, roared,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>tumbled like raging wild beasts clawing at the rocks.
On the extreme edge of its point arose a mass of gray
stone buildings scarcely to be distinguished from the
foundation on which they were built.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How far is it to Enderby Castle?” inquired Mr.
Force of the coachman who drove his carriage.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ten miles from the station, sir,” replied the man,
touching his hat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is the castle,” said Mrs. Force, pointing to the
pile of buildings on the edge of the promontory, and
handing the field glass with which she had been taking
a view of her birthplace and first home.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That! It is a fine, commanding situation, but it
scarcely looks to be more than five miles from here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is not, if we could take a bee line over land and
sea, but the road has to follow the bend of the estuary,”
replied the lady.</p>

<p class='c008'>All the occupants of both carriages, which had come
to a standstill, were now on their feet gazing at that
hoary headland, capped with its ancient stronghold.</p>

<p class='c008'>The field glass was passed from one to another, while
the carriages paused long enough for all to take a view.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So that was the home of my grandparents and of
our forefathers for—how long, dear mamma?” inquired
Odalite.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eight centuries, my dear. The round tower that you
see is the oldest part of the edifice, and was built by
Kedrik of Enderbee in the year 950.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lord, what a fine time the rats, mice, bats, owls,
rooks and ghosts must have in it!” remarked Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is like a picture in a Christmas ghost story,” said
Elva.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It seems like Aunt Sukey was reading it all to me
out of a novel by the evening fire at Grove Hill,” mused
Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go on,” said Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>And the carriages started again.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>The road, still running along the top of the cliff,
turned gradually more and more to the left until its
course verged from the north to the northwest, and then
to the west, as it entered upon the long, high point of
land upon which stood the castle. The road now began
to ascend another steep, paved with stones on edge to
make a hold for the horses’ feet in climbing, and at
length entered a sort of alley between huge stone walls
that rose higher and higher on either side as the road
ascended, until it reached a heavy gateway flanked with
towers, between which, and over the gateway, hung the
spiked and rusting iron portcullis, looking as if it were
ready, at the touch of a spring, to fall and impale any
audacious intruder who might pass beneath it. But it
was fast rusted into its place, where it had been stationary
for ages.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder who was the last warder that raised this
portcullis?” mused Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I cannot tell you, my dear. It has not been moved
in the memory of man,” replied Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see ghosts again!” exclaimed Wynnette—“men-at-arms
on yonder battlements! Knights, squires and pursuivants
in the courtyard here! Oh, what a haunted
hole is this!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They entered a quadrangular courtyard paved with
flagstones, inclosed by stone buildings, and having at
each of the four corners a strong tower.</p>

<p class='c008'>The front building, through which they had passed by
the ascending road, was the most ancient part of the
castle and faced the sea. But in the rear of that was
the more recent structure, used as the dwelling of the
earl and his household. This modern building also
faced the sea, on the other side, but it could not be approached
from the cliff road except through the front.
These buildings were not used at all. They were given
over to the denizens objected to by Wynnette—to rats,
mice, bats, owls and rooks, and—perhaps ghosts.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>On either side the buildings were used as quarters for
the servants and offices for the household.</p>

<p class='c008'>They drove through the courtyard, under an archway
in the wall of the modern building, and out to the front
entrance, facing the open sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many steps led from the pavement up to the massive
oaken doors, flanked by huge pillars of stone, that gave
admittance to the building.</p>

<p class='c008'>The coachman left his box, went up these stairs and
knocked.</p>

<p class='c008'>The double doors swung open.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force alighted and handed out his wife and two
elder daughters, while Le performed the same service
for Elva and Rosemary, and the party walked up the
stairs to the open door.</p>

<p class='c008'>A footman in the gray livery of Enderby bowed
them in.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXXI<br /> <span class='large'>MRS. FORCE’S BROTHER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A tall, fair, delicate-looking patrician of about forty
years of age, clothed in an India silk dressing gown,
leaning on the arm of his gray-haired valet, and further
supporting himself by a gold-headed cane, approached
to welcome them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My sister—I am glad to see you, Elfrida,” he said,
passing his cane over to his valet and taking the lady
by the hand to give her his brotherly kiss. “Now present
me to your husband and daughters, and to these—young
friends of yours. I am glad to see them all.
Very glad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Force introduced Mr. Force, Leonidas and the
girls in turn.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Lord Enderby shook hands with each in succession,
and heartily welcomed them all to Enderby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You must take your place at the head of my bachelor
household, Elfrida. In the meantime, my housekeeper,
Mrs. Kelsy here, will show you to your rooms.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As he spoke, an elderly woman, in her Sunday dress
of black silk, with a white net shoulder shawl and a
white net cap, came from the rear of the hall, courtesied,
and said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“My lady, this way, if you please.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Breakfast will be served as soon as you are ready for
it, Elfrida,” said the host, as, still leaning on the arm of
his valet and supporting himself by his cane, he turned
and passed through a door on the right, into his own
sanctum.</p>

<p class='c008'>Widely yawned the foot of the broad staircase, up
which Mrs. Kelsy led the guests of the house, to a vast
upper hall, flanked with oaken doors leading into a suit
of apartments on either side.</p>

<p class='c008'>The housekeeper opened a door on the right, saying:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here is a suit of five rooms, my lady, fitted up for
yourself and the young ladies. And here, on the opposite
side, is a large room, with dressing room attached,
for the young gentlemen—Good Lord!!”</p>

<p class='c008'>This sudden exclamation from the housekeeper was
called forth by the unexpected apparition of Gipsy, the
negro maid, than whom no blacker human being ever
saw the light. Gipsy was as black as ink, as black as
ebony. Wynnette declared that charcoal made a light-colored
mark on her. But aside from her complexion,
Gipsy was a good-looking girl, with laughing black eyes,
and laughing lips that disclosed fine white teeth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is my maid, Zipporah, but we call her Gipsy
for convenience,” said Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, my lady! Will it bite? Can’t it talk? Is it
vicious?” inquired the Cumberland woman, who had
never seen and scarcely ever heard of a negro, and had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>the vaguest idea of dark-colored savages in distant parts
of the world, who were pagans and cannibals.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She is a very good girl, and can read and write as
well as any of us; and she is, besides, a member of the
Episcopal church at home, which is the same as your
Church of England here,” Mrs. Force explained.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, my lady. Certainly, my lady. I beg pardon,
my lady, I am sure,” said the housekeeper, in profuse
apology; but still she did not seem satisfied, but gave
Gipsy a wide berth while she eyed her suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now Gipsy resented this sort of treatment; besides,
she was a bit of a wag; so every time her mistress’
back was turned she rolled up the whites of her big eyes,
curled up her large red lips, and snapped her teeth together,
in a way that made Kelsy’s blood run cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as it was possible to do so, she made an excuse
and left the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where is Dickon?” inquired Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s round at the kennel with the dog. Joshua
won’t make friends ’long o’ none of the grooms, nor
likewise none o’ the doogs, so Dickon have to stay ’long
o’ him to keep him quiet,” said Gipsy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force groaned.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now everything is going to be laid on that poor dog!
Gipsy, I won’t give you my crimson silk dress when I
have done with it, just for that. Papa, I can help you
to dress just as well as Dickon can—and a great deal
better, too. I can fix your shaving things and hair
brushes, and lay out your clothes myself!” exclaimed
Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear, I think you had better prepare for breakfast,”
said her mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mother, we can’t do much preparing, as our trunks
have not been brought up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take off your duster, my dear, and wash your face
and hands, and brush your hair,” suggested Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>“I suppose these two rooms are yours and papa’s, but
which are ours?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Force walked through the whole suit, and finally
assigned a room next to her own to Wynnette and Odalite,
and another to Elva and Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c008'>What struck all these visitors was the heavy and
rather gloomy character of their apartments. Thick
Brussels carpets, thick moreen window curtains, and
bed curtains of dull colors and dingy appearance, massive
bedsteads, bureaus, presses and chairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And they call this the modern part of the castle!
Oh, I know I shall see ghosts!” said Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>When they were all ready, they went downstairs to
the hall, all hung with suits of armor, and decorated
with arms, shields, spears, banners, battle-axes, and so
on, and with stags’ heads and other trophies of the battlefield
and the chase.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here a footman showed them into the breakfast room,
where the earl sat waiting for them. Breakfast was
served in a very few minutes.</p>

<p class='c008'>After breakfast the whole party adjourned to the
drawing room, a vast, gloomy apartment with walls lined
with old oil paintings, windows hung with heavy, dark
curtains; floor covered with a thick, dull carpet, and
filled up with massive furniture.</p>

<p class='c008'>After they had been seated for a while, the earl arose,
taking his cane in one hand and the arm of his brother-in-law
with the other, and said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope you will amuse yourselves as you please, my
dears, and excuse me: I wish to have a talk on family
matters with your parents in the library. If you would
like to go over the house, call one of the maids or the
housekeeper to be your guide,” he concluded, as he left
the room, accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite acted on her uncle’s suggestion, rang the bell,
and requested to see the housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>Mrs. Kelsy came, and on being requested, expressed
her willingness to show the young ladies over the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And to the picture gallery first, if you please,” she
said, as she led the way across the hall to a long room
on the opposite side.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here were the family portraits.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Odalite, here are the originals of all the ghosts I saw
with my eyes shut, on last night’s journey, and of all the
ghosts I saw here on the battlements and in the courtyard—all,
all, all—men-at-arms, squires, knights, lords
and ladies. If they would but talk, what interesting
shades they would be!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Which, Wynnette? The ghosts or the pictures?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Either. Both. This, you say, Mrs. Kelsy, was Elfrida,
Lady Enderby, my mother’s mother? Why, I
should have known it. How much she is like my
mother, and like Elva. And this is the second and last
Lady Enderby? How lovely, yet how fragile. She was
mamma’s stepmother, and she died young, leaving one
delicate little boy, our uncle, the present earl. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sic transit</span></i>,
and so forth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They spent an hour in the picture gallery, and then
the housekeeper proposed that they go into the library.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But we cannot go there. Papa, mamma and uncle
are shut up there, in close council,” said Odalite.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah! Well, we will go upstairs, if you please, miss,”
said Kelsy.</p>

<p class='c008'>And upstairs they went. And all over the vast building
they went, finding only gloomy rooms, each one more
depressing than the others.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now show me the room Queen Elizabeth slept
in when on a visit to Baron Ealon, of Enderby,” said
Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Queen Elizabeth, miss! I never heard that Queen
Elizabeth was ever in this part of the country!” the
housekeeper exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>“Oh, well, then,” she said, “show me the room that
Alexander the Great, or Julius Cæsar, or Napoleon
Bonaparte, or George Washington slept in.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—do not think I ever heard of any of these grandees
stopping at Enderby. But there is a room——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, yes!” eagerly exclaimed Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where the Young Pretender was hidden for days
before he escaped to France,” said the housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, show us that room, Mrs. Kelsy,” said a chorus
of voices.</p>

<p class='c008'>The housekeeper took them down a long flight of
stairs and along a dark passage, and up another flight of
stairs, and through a suit of unfurnished apartments, to
a large room in the rear of the main building, whose
black oak floor and whose paneled walls were bare, and
whose windows were curtainless.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the middle of this room stood a huge bedstead,
whose four posts were the dragon supporters of the arms
of Enderby and whose canopy was surmounted by an
earl’s coronet. The velvet hangings of this bedstead, the
brocade quilt and satin pillow cases had almost gone the
way of all perishable things.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And the Young Pretender occupied this room?” inquired
Rosemary, reverently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, miss, and it is kept just as he left it, except
that the curtains have been taken from the windows,
because they had fallen into rags.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And he slept in this bed?” said Elva, timidly laying
her hand upon the sacred relic.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, miss, but I wouldn’t touch the quilt, if I was
you. Bless you, it would go to pieces if you were to
handle it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I would make a bonfire of every unhealthy mess in
this room, if it were mine!” said Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>The housekeeper looked at her in silent horror.</p>

<p class='c008'>They lingered some time in “the pretender’s room.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>As they were leaving it, Wynnette said, at random:</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now show us the haunted chamber, please.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The housekeeper stopped short, turned pale and
stared at the speaker.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who told you anything about the haunted room?”
she inquired.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nobody did,” replied Wynnette, staring in her turn.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How, then, did you know anything about it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“By inference. Given an old castle, inferred a
haunted room. Come, now, show it to us, dear Mrs.
Kelsy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, you cannot see the haunted chamber, young
miss. It has not been opened for ten years or more.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come! This is getting to be exciting, and I declare
I will see it, if I die for it,” said Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not through my means, you will not, young lady.
But there is the luncheon bell, and we had better go
down.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They returned to the inhabited parts of the house,
and were shown by the housekeeper to the morning room,
where the luncheon table was spread.</p>

<p class='c008'>There they found Mr. and Mrs. Force. Their host
had not yet joined them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear,” said Mr. Force, in a low voice, addressing
Odalite, “we have had a consultation in the library. It
is almost certain that Lady Mary Anglesea died one
year before the time stated as that of her death. It is
best, however, that we go down to Angleton and search
for evidence in the church and mausoleum. Therefore,
it is decided that Leonidas and myself go to Lancashire
to-morrow to investigate the facts, leaving your mother,
sisters, and self here. We shall only be absent for a
few days.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, papa! then you will take poor John Kirby’s letter
and parcel to his old father there? You see, they
live only a few miles from Angleton,” said Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, dear, I will take them,” assented the squire.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“And, Odalite, my love,” he added, turning to his eldest
daughter, “if all goes well we shall have a merry marriage
here at Enderby.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXXII<br /> <span class='large'>AN ANXIOUS SEARCH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Early the next morning Mr. Force, Leonidas and
Wynnette, who begged to make one of the party, left
Enderby Castle for Lancashire.</p>

<p class='c008'>The gray-haired coachman drove them in an open carriage
to the Nethermost Railway Station.</p>

<p class='c008'>On this drive they retraced the road on the top of the
cliffs which they had traversed on the previous day.</p>

<p class='c008'>They reached Nethermost just in time to jump on
board the “parliamentary,” a slow train—none but slow
trains ever did stop at this obscure and unfrequented
station.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force secured a first-class compartment for himself
and party, and they were soon comfortably seated
and being whirled onward toward Lancaster.</p>

<p class='c008'>For some miles the road followed the line of the coast
in a southerly direction, and then diverged a little to
the eastward until it reached the ancient and picturesque
town of Lancaster, perched upon its own hill and
crowned with its old castle, which dates back to the time
of John of Gaunt.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here they left their train, and on consulting the local
time-table in the ticket office found that the next train
on the branch line going to the station nearest Angleton
did not start until 3 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span></p>

<p class='c008'>This, as it was now but 11 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, gave the party
an opportunity of seeing the town, as well as of getting
a luncheon.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>A chorus of voices offered cabs; but Mr. Force, waving
them all away, walked up the street of antiquated
houses and brought his party to the ancient inn of “The
Royal Oak.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Here he ordered luncheon, to be ready at two, and
then set out with his young people to walk through the
town.</p>

<p class='c008'>They climbed the hill and viewed the castle, now
fallen from its ancient glory of a royal fortress—not
into ruin, but into deeper degradation as the county jail.
But the donjon keep, King John’s Tower, and John of
Gaunt’s Gate remain as of old.</p>

<p class='c008'>They next visited the old parish church of St. Mary’s,
where they saw some wonderful stained glass windows,
brass statuary, and oak carvings of a date to which the
memory of man reached not back.</p>

<p class='c008'>They could only gaze upon the outside of the cotton
and silk factories and the iron foundries before the
clock in the church tower struck two, and they returned
to the hotel for lunch.</p>

<p class='c008'>At three o’clock they took the train for Angleton.</p>

<p class='c008'>Their course now lay eastward through many a mile
of the manufacturing districts, and then entered a moorland,
waste and sparsely inhabited, stretching eastward
to the range of mountains known in local phraseology
as “England’s Backbone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was six o’clock on a warm June afternoon when
the slow train stopped at a little, lonely station, in the
midst of a moor, where there was not another house
anywhere in sight.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here our travelers left their compartment and came
out upon the platform, carpetbags in hand; and the
train went on its way.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our party paused on the platform, looking about
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>On their right hand stood the station, a small, strong
building of stone with two rooms and a ticket office.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>Behind that the moor stretched out in unbroken solitude
to the horizon.</p>

<p class='c008'>On their left hand was the track of the railroad, and
beyond that the moor rolling into low hills, toward the
distant range of mountains.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was not a vehicle of any sort in sight; and there
were but two human beings besides themselves on the
spot—one was the ticket agent and the other the railway
porter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force spoke to the latter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where can I get a carriage to take my party on to
Angleton?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The man, a red, shock-haired rustic, stared at the
questioner a minute before answering.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Noa whurr, maister, leaf it be at t’ Whoit Coo.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And where is the White Cow?” inquired the gentleman.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rustic stretched his arm out and pointed due
east.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force strained his eyes in that direction, but at
first could see nothing but the moor stretching out in
the distance and rolling into hills as it reached the range
of mountains.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Papa,” said Wynnette, who was straining her eyes
also, “I think I see the place. I know I see a curl of
smoke and the top of a chimney, and the peak of a
gable-end roof. I think the rise of the ground prevents
our seeing more.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oie, oie, yon’s t’ Whoit Coo,” assented the porter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How far is it from here?” inquired Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Taw mulls, maister.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can you go there and bring us a carriage of some sort?<a id='t195'></a>
I will pay you well for your trouble,” said Mr.
Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Naw, maister. Oi’ mawn’t leave t’ stution.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle!” exclaimed Le, “I can go and bring you a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>carriage in no time. You take Wynnette into the house
and wait for me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And without more ado Le ran across the track and
strode off across the moor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force took Wynnette into the waiting room of
the little wayside station, where they sat down.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no carpet on the floor, no paper on the
walls, no shades at the windows, but against the walls
were rows of wooden benches, and on them large posters
of railway and steamboat routes, hotels, watering places,
and so forth, and one picture of the winner of the last
Derby.</p>

<p class='c008'>They had scarcely time to get tired of waiting before
Le came back with the most wretched-looking turnout
that ever tried to be a useful conveyance.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a long cart covered with faded and torn black
leather, and furnished with wooden seats without cushions.
Its harness was worn and patched. But there
was one comfort in the whole equipage—the horse was
in very good condition. It was a strong draught horse.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall not have to cry for cruelty to animals, at any
rate,” said Wynnette, as her father helped her up into
a seat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How far is it to Angleton?” inquired Mr. Force of
the driver.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sux mulls, surr,” answered the man. “Sux mulls,
if yur tek it cross t’ moor, but tun, ’round b’ t’ rood.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is it very rough across the moor?” inquired Mr.
Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Muddlin’, maister,” replied the man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go across the moor,” said the gentleman, as he
stepped up into the carriage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le followed him. The horse started and trudged on,
jolting them over the irons on the railway track and
striking into the very worst country road they had ever
known.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yes. It was rough riding across that moor, sitting on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>hard benches, in a cart without springs, and drawn by a
strong, hard-trotting horse.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our travelers were jolted until their bones were sore
before they reached the first stopping place.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was “‘The White Cow,” an old-fashioned inn, in
a dip of the moor, where the ground began to roll in
hills and hollows toward the distant mountains.</p>

<p class='c008'>The house fronted east, and, as it lay basking in the
late afternoon summer sun, was very picturesque. Its
steep, gable roof was of red tiles, with tall, twisted
chimneys, and projecting dormer windows; its walls
were of some dark, gray stone, with broad windows and
doors, and a great archway leading into the stable yard.
A staff, with a swinging sign, stood before the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>The declining sun threw the shadow of the house in
front of it; and in this shade a pair of country laborers
sat on a bench, with a table before them. They were
smoking short pipes and drinking beer, which stood in
pewter pots on the board.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was the only sign of life and business about the
still place.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the cart drew up Mr. Force got out of it and
helped his daughter to alight.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le followed them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think we will go in the house and rest a while, and
see if we can get a decent cup of tea, my dear. We
have had nothing since we left Lancaster, at three
o’clock, and it is now half-past seven. You must be
both tired and hungry,” said the squire, leading her in.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“‘I’m killed, sire,’”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>responded Wynnette, misapplying a line from Browning,
as she limped along on her father’s arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man who had driven them from the railway
station, and whom after developments proved to be
waiter, hostler, groom and bootblack rolled into one for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>the guests of the White Cow, left his horse and cart
standing and ran before Mr. Force to show the travelers
into the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was needless; but he did it.</p>

<p class='c008'>They entered a broad hall paved with flagstones.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the left of this an open door revealed the taproom,
half full of rustic workingmen, who were smoking,
drinking, laughing and talking, and whose forms
loomed indistinctly through the thick smoke, tinted in
one corner like a golden mist by the horizontal rays of
the setting sun that streamed obliquely through the end
window.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the right another open door revealed a large low-ceiled
parlor, with whitewashed walls and sanded floor,
a broad window in front filled with flowering plants in
pots, and a broad fireplace at the back filled with evergreen
boughs and cut paper flowers. On the walls were
cheap colored pictures, purporting to be portraits of the
queen and members of the royal family. Against the
walls were ranged Windsor chairs. On the mantelpiece
stood an eight-day clock, flanked by a pair of sperm
candles, in brass candlesticks.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the middle of the floor stood a square table, covered
with a damask cloth as white as new fallen snow,
and so smooth and glossy, with such sharp lines where
it had been folded, that proved it to have been just taken
from the linen press and spread upon the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>The house might be old-fashioned and somewhat
dilapidated, not to say tumble-down, as to its outward
appearance; but this large, low-ceiled room was clean,
neat, fresh and fragrant as it was possible for a room
to be.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is pleasant, isn’t it, papa?” said Wynnette, as
she stood by the flowery window, threw off her brown
straw hat, pulled off her gloves, drew off her duster,
put them all upon one chair and dropped herself into another.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>“Yes. If the tea proves as good as the room, we
shall be content,” replied Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man-of-all-work, who had slipped out and put
on a clean apron, and taken up a clean towel, with magical
expedition, now reappeared to take orders.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What would you please to have, sir?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tea for the party, and anything else you have in the
house that is good to eat with it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And the waiter pulled the white tablecloth this way
and that and smoothed it with the palms of his hands,
apparently for no other reason than to prove his zeal,
for he did not improve the cloth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force and Le walked out “to look around,” they
said.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXXIII<br /> <span class='large'>A CLEW</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The one maid-of-all-work came in and asked the
young lady if she would not like to go to a room and
wash her face and hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette decidedly would like it, and said so.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl was a fresh, wholesome-looking English lass,
with rosy cheeks and rippling red hair. She wore a
dark blue dress of some cheap woolen material, with a
white apron and white collar.</p>

<p class='c008'>She led the young lady out into the hall again, and
up a flight of broad stone steps to an upper hall, and
thence into a front bed chamber, immediately over the
parlor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here again were the whitewashed walls, clean bare
floor, the broad, white-shaded window, the open fireplace
filled with evergreens, the polished wooden chairs,
ranged along the walls, and all the dainty neatness of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>the room below. There were, besides, a white-curtained
bed, with a strip of carpet on each side of it; a white-draped
dressing table with an oval glass, and a white-covered
washstand, with white china basin and ewer.
In a word, it was a pure, fresh, dainty, and fragrant
white room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, what a nice place! Oh, how I should like to
stay here to-night, instead of going further!” exclaimed
Wynnette, appreciatively.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl made no reply, but began to lay out towels
on the washstand, and to pour water from the ewer into
the basin.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is a very lonesome country, though, isn’t it?”
inquired Wynnette, who was bound to talk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s not a many gentry, ma’am. There be mill
hands and pitmen mostly about here,” said the girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mill hands and pitmen! I saw no mills nor mines,
either, as we drove along.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, ma’am; but they beant far off. The hills do
hide them just about here; but you might seen the high
chimneys—I mean the tops of ’em and the smoke.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are they pitmen down there in the barroom?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the taproom? Yes, ma’am. Mill hands, and
farm hands, too. They do come in at this hour for their
beer and ’bacco.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you have many more customers besides these
men?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not ivery day, ma’am; but we hev the farmers on
their way to Middlemoor market stop here; and—and
the gentry coming and going betwixt the station and
Fell Hall, or Middlemoor Court, or Anglewood Manor,
ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How far is Anglewood Manor from this?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“About five miles, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Five!’ Why, I thought it wasn’t more than four.
The coachman told us it was only six from the station
and we have come two.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>“That was Anglewood village, I reckon, ma’am. That
is only four miles from here; but Anglewood Manor is
a short mile beyant that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah! Who keeps this inn? There is no name on
the sign.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, ma’am. It’s ‘T’ Whoit Coo.’ It allers hev been
‘T’ Whoit Coo,’ ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But who keeps it?” persisted inquisitive Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oo! Me mawther keeps it, iver sin’ feyther deed,
ma’am. Mawther tends bar hersen, and Jonah waits
and waters horses, and cleans boots, and does odd jobs,
and I be chambermaid.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah! and who is Jonah?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Me brawther.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah! And so your mother, your brother, and yourself
do all the work and run the hotel?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, ma’am. It would no pay us else,” replied the
“Maid of the Inn,” who seemed to be as much inclined
to be communicative as Wynnette was to be inquisitive.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, well, it is lucky that you are all able to do so.
But you have not told me your name yet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mine be Hetty Kirby, ma’am. Brawther Jonah’s
be Jonah, and mawther’s be the Widow Kirby,” definitely
replied the girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Kirby!’ Oh—why——Tell me, did you have a
relation named John Kirby go to America once upon a
time?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, ma’am, a long time ago, before I can remember,
me Oncle John Kirby, me feyther’s yo’ngest brawther,
went there and never come back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! And—is your grandfather living?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The “Maid of the Inn” stared. What was all this
to the young lady? Wynnette interpreted her look and
explained:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because, if he is living, I have got a letter and a
bundle for him from his son in New York.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Law! hev you, though, ma’am? Look at thet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>noo! What wonders in this world. The grandfeyther
is living, ma’am, but not in Moorton. He be lately
coom to dwell wi’ ‘is son Job, me Oncle Job, who be sexton
at Anglewood church.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sexton at Anglewood church! Is your uncle sexton
at Anglewood church? And does your grandfather, old
Mr. Kirby, live with him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The maid of the inn stared again. Why should this
strange young lady take so much interest in the Kirbys?</p>

<p class='c008'>Again Wynnette interpreted her look, and explained:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because if your grandfather does live there, it will
save us a journey to Moorton, as we are going to Anglewood,
and can give him the letter and parcel without
turning out of our way,” she said; but she was also
thinking that if this old Kirby, to whom she was bringing
letters and presents from his son in America, was
the father of the sexton at Anglewood church, an inmate
of his cottage, and probably assistant in his work, these
circumstances might greatly facilitate their admission
into vaults and mausoleums which the party had come
to see, but which might otherwise have been closed to
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, ma’am,” said Hetty, “would you mind letting
mawther see the letter and parcel?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, certainly not; but I have no right to let her open
either of them, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She shawnt, ma’am; but it wull do the mawther
good to see the outside ’n ’em. And o’ Sunday, when
she goes to church, she can see the grandfeyther, and
get to read t’ letter. And there be t’ bell, ma’am. And
we mun goo doon to tea.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette was ready, and went downstairs, attended
by the girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>A dainty and delicious repast was spread upon the
table. Tea, whose rich aroma filled the room and proved
its excellence, muffins, sally-lunns, biscuits, buttered
toast, rich milk, cream and butter, fried chicken,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>poached eggs, sliced tongue and ham, radishes, pepper
grass, cheese, marmalade, jelly, pound cake and plum
cake.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette’s eyes danced as she saw the feast.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is as good as a St. Mary’s county spread! And
I couldn’t say more for it if I were to talk all day!” she
exclaimed, as she took her place at the head of the table
to pour out the tea.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force asked a blessing, just as he would have
done if he had been at home, and then the three hungry
travelers “fell to.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Father,” said Wynnette, when she had poured out
the tea, which Hetty began to hand around, “do you
know the Widow Kirby who keeps this hotel——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Inn, my dear—inn,” amended the squire. “I am so
happy to find myself in an old-fashioned inn that I
protest against its being insulted with the name of
hotel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, squire,” said Wynnette.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘A sweet by any other smell would name as rose,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>or words to that effect. The landlady of this hostelry—I
should say tavern—I mean inn—the landlady of this
inn is the Widow Kirby, sister-in-law to the baggage
master who took care of Joshua, and from whom we
brought the letter and parcel, you know. And this
young person is his niece, and the man who drove us
here is his nephew. And his brother is sexton at Anglewood
Church, and his father lives there. Now! What
do you think of that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We knew from the baggage master that the Kirbys
lived in Lancashire, so we need not be surprised to find
them here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, papa, Lancashire is a large place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My love, it has been said that the habitable globe is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>but a small place, and we are always sure to meet some
of the same people everywhere.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, the widow wants to see the letter and the
parcel—the outside of them, I mean.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, there is no objection,” said the squire. And
he made a move to reach his valise.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Le hastily anticipated him and brought it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The kind-hearted squire unlocked the case, found the
letter and the parcel, and gave them into the hands of
the young waitress.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oo! Thanky’, sir. Thanky’, ma’am. Thanky’,” she
said, and continued to say, bobbing courtesies, and turning
over and staring at the letter and the parcel as she
took them out of the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wynnette, my dear, you find out everything; but
you have missed your vocation. You ought to have been
a newspaper correspondent or a detective.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know it, papa. I know it!” exclaimed the girl,
with a very demonstrative sigh. “And that’s the complaint
with most of us. We’re nearly all out of place,
and therefore in pain, like dislocated limbs. And that’s
what’s the matter with humanity. Almost all its members
are put out of joint.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The rich glow of the summer sunset was slowly fading
from the west.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lights were brought in by the factotum, Jonah, who
placed two on the tea table, and then proceeded to light
the two that stood upon the mantelpiece.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having done this, the man stood waiting orders.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you put up the carriage?” inquired Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Naw, maister. The carriage be waiting.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, then, you may just as well put it up. It is
growing dark, and I do not feel like crossing the moor
at this time of night. We will stay here, if you can let
us have bedrooms.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Surely, maister, we ha’ rooms enough. I’ll call
Hetty.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>The chambermaid was called, and bringing the letter
and parcel, still unopened, and her “mawther’s” duty
and thanks to the gentlefolks for letting her see the outside
of them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hetty, on being interviewed on the subject of sleeping
accommodations, declared in effect that “The White
Cow” could provide comfortable quarters for the whole
party, for if the two gentlemen would share the double-bedded
chamber over the taproom, the young lady could
have the large single-bedded chamber over the parlor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That will be perfectly lovely. I did long to sleep
in that very room, at least for one night,” said Wynnette,
without waiting for any one else to speak.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, then. That will do. We will stay. Eh,
Le?” said the squire, turning to his young companion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly, uncle. The half of a large bedded chamber
is ample space for one used to a hammock,” replied
Le.</p>

<p class='c008'>So it was settled, and as the travelers were fatigued,
they retired early.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Early the next morning our three travelers were
astir.</p>

<p class='c008'>They met in the neat parlor, where the air was delicious
with the fragrance of fresh white, pink and blue
hyacinths that filled the flower pots in the broad window.</p>

<p class='c008'>They sat around the table, on which was arranged a
breakfast that quite equaled in excellence the tea of the
evening before.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jonah waited on the party.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is that elegant and commodious equipage which
brought us here yesterday the best thing in the way of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>a carriage that the White Cow can turn out?” inquired
Mr. Force, as he sipped his coffee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Beg pardon, maister?” said the man, with a puzzled
look.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t you trot out a better trap than that old hurdle
on wheels which jolted us from the railway station yesterday?”
demanded Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Beg pardon, ma’am?” said the man, with a bewildered
look.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We wish to know if you have not a better carriage
than the one in which we came here,” Le tried to explain.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Naw, maister, t’ Whoit Coo hev naw much demand
fo’ ’m. T’ gentry do most come and go in their own,
and send t’ same for or call t’ friends in visiting,” the
man replied, in a tone of apology.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well. Have the cart at the door as soon as it
can be brought here, and bring me my bill.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, maister.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They all got up from the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Papa,” said Wynnette, who was too well inclined to
take the initiative in most matters, “papa, I think if we
can get our business done at the manor to-day, we had
better come back here to take supper and to sleep. It
seems to me that it would be much nicer than to stop at
Angleton.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait until you see Angleton before you decide, my
dear. You may find the ‘Anglesea Arms’ as attractive
as this inn,” replied the squire, who was drawing on his
railway duster—a needless operation, since there was
no more dust on the moor than could have been found
on the sea.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘The Anglesea Arms,’ papa? No, thank you. The
name is enough for me. I would rather sit in the old
cart all day and eat bread and cheese, and sleep in the
cart all night, gypsy fashion, than take rest or refreshment
at the Anglesea Arms,” exclaimed Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>“But, my dear, you are unjust. The inn has nothing
to do with the man, beyond the accident of having been
on the land of his ancestors centuries ago, and handed
down the name from generation to generation.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t help it, papa! I should feel—disgraced—there
if I were to find myself by any accident under the roof
of the—Anglesea Arms.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whe-ew-ew! Poor, old inn,” whistled Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>Oh, no doubt he ought to have lectured his wilful
little daughter; but he did not. He was a child-spoiler,
a chickpecked papa.</p>

<p class='c008'>By this time they were ready to start.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jonah brought the bill.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force paid it, and gave the waiter half a crown.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette pulled his sleeve and whispered:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Papa, give me half a sov. to tip the chambermaid.
It’s the regular thing, you know. I mean, papa, dear,
that it is usual for ladies to offer some such modest recognition
of such young persons’ services.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What, my dear, have you no money?” inquired her
father, looking at her in some surprise.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“‘Oh, sir, you see me here,</div>
      <div class='line'>A most poor woman, though a queen,’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>sighed Wynnette, in a very humble air, as she held out
her open hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>The squire poured into her palm some loose silver and
one piece of gold—the whole not amounting to so much
as five dollars.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette thanked him and skipped out of the parlor
to find Hetty.</p>

<p class='c008'>She found her waiting just outside the door. Hetty
was a very good girl in her way; but she profited by
the traditions of her class, and generally was to be found
waiting when ladies were leaving the inn.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette pressed the half sovereign into the hand of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>the girl. Wynnette was a generous and extravagant
little wretch, without the slightest idea of the value of
money, and therefore likely, in some opinions, to come
to poverty.</p>

<p class='c008'>This half sovereign was about four times as much as
the maid ever got from the richest of the inn’s guests;
and she courtesied about four times as often in return.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Small favors gratefully acknowledged, large ones in
proportion,” seemed to be her just and simple rule.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come, Wynnette. Come, my dear,” called her
father, who was already in the hall waiting for her.</p>

<p class='c008'>In another minute the whole party were in the dilapidated
carryall, and the driver turned the horse’s head
eastward into an almost invisible roadway over the moor.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a splendid June morning. The sky was of a
deep, clear sapphire blue so seldom seen even on the
sunniest days in England. The moor took a darker
shade of color from the sky, and the heather with which
it was thickly overgrown seemed of a deep, intense
green. The ground rolled in hills and dales, gradually
rising higher and higher toward the range of mountains
on the eastern horizon, where the highest ridges were
capped with soft, snow-white clouds. As the sun rose
higher, these clouds, as well as the mountain sides, became
tinted with the most delicate and beautiful hues of
rose, azure, emerald and gold, melting into each other
and forming the loveliest varieties of color, light and
shade.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet in the vast solitude of the moor no human being
or human dwelling was to be seen.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first sign of habitation was a thin spire which
seemed to rise in mid distance before them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is that?” inquired Mr. Force of the driver.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thet, maister, be the steeple of old Anglewood
Church.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are we so near the manor, then?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>“Naw, sir. It be better’n three mulls off yet. You
would naw see it, only for the air is so clear the day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette craned her neck to look forward. But there
was nothing to be seen but the thin spire, as if drawn
with pen and ink from the dark blue heath to the deep
blue sky.</p>

<p class='c008'>As they went on, the spire became a steeple, and the
steeple a tower, and the tower a church.</p>

<p class='c008'>As yet nothing but the church—darkly outlined
against the background of hills—was visible. They
were now on the top of one of the rolling hills, and could
see it clearly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is that church in the village of Angleton or in the
manor of Anglewood?” inquired Mr. Force of the driver.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It be on t’ manor, maister. The village it be nearer
t’ us, but being in t’ hollow you can’t see it yet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They went down the hill and through the hollow,
came up the side of another higher hill, and then looked
down on the village of Angleton in the vale at its foot.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the top of the next hill stood the Old Church of
Anglewood in full view.</p>

<p class='c008'>The driver stopped his horse while they looked at the
village in the vale and the church on the hill beyond.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wull I drive to the Anglesea Arms, maister?” inquired
the driver, as he set his horse in motion again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” replied the squire, in deference to Wynnette.
He had “won his spurs elsewhere,” no doubt, but the
chickpecked papa was a little afraid of his baby. “No;
but I want to stop at the village for a few minutes. Is
there a newspaper published at Angleton?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir. T’ Angleton <cite>’Wertiser</cite> it be,” replied the
man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well, then. Drive to the office of that paper.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, maister.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They were now descending a steep road, between low
stone walls, leading down into the main street of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>village and past the one public house, the one general
store, the doctor’s office and surgery, the lawyer’s office,
and finally the printing and publishing office of the
Angleton <cite>Advertiser</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a two-storied stone building, evidently a dwelling
house as well as a printing office; for there were
two doors—one apparently a private door, leading into
a narrow hall; the other the public door, broad and
rough, and leading into the business rooms. Besides the
upper windows were hung with Norfolk lace curtains
and adorned with pots of geraniums, while the lower
windows were shaded with dust and draped with cobwebs,
and sustained above them the broad signboard—Angleton
<cite>Advertiser</cite>.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the carriage drew up before this building the
three travelers alighted and went in.</p>

<p class='c008'>The driver of the vehicle remained in his seat in
charge.</p>

<p class='c008'>The party of three found themselves in a very dingy
room, with a counter on their right hand, at the nearest
end of which a man stood writing at a desk. At the
furthest end a boy stood folding and wrapping papers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is this the office of the Angleton <cite>Advertiser</cite>?” needlessly
inquired Mr. Force of the gentleman behind the
desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is. What can I have the pleasure of doing for
you, sir?” inquired the latter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are the proprietor?” half asserted, half inquired
the squire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Proprietor, editor, printer and publisher,” answered
the man, reaching behind him and taking from a shelf a
copy of his paper, which he offered to his visitor, saying:
“Out to-day, sir; and there’s my name.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah!” said Mr. Force, spreading the paper before
him, and looking first at the prospectus for the name of
his new acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>“Can I be of any service to you, sir?” inquired the
proprietor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Mr. Purdy, I would like to have a few minutes
talk with you, if you are not too busy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am directing papers for the mail, but I am not
pressed for time, as the mail does not go until to-night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you,” said the squire, as a mere form, for
there did not appear to be any particular cause for gratitude.
And he drew from his breast pocket a certain
copy of the Angleton <cite>Advertiser</cite> and handed it to the
man, saying again: “Thank you, Mr. Purdy. My
name is Force. I only wish to ask you—and I hope
without offense—what is the meaning of the obituary
notice of a living man that is published in the first
column of this paper?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Purdy took the paper in a slow and dazed manner, and
looked at the column which Mr. Force pointed out to
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>And as he looked he stared and stared.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—I—don’t understand!” he said at last, looking
from the paper up to the face of his strange visitor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Neither do I understand, Mr. Purdy; but if we put
our heads together perhaps we may be able to do so,”
replied Abel Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>The printer turned the paper over and over, in and
out, up and down, and, lastly, back to the front page;
and then he stared at the obituary notice of his landlord.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you make of it?” inquired Abel Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t make anything of it. But I think it will
make a lunatic of me! This is certainly my paper! I
know my paper as well as I know my children. This is
certainly my paper—though it is an old one—and this is
the obituary notice of Col. Anglesea, who was alive and
well at that very time, and is so at this present, as I
think.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do you account for that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t account for it! If I weren’t a sound man,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>and a sober man, and a wide-awake one, I should think
I was drunk, or dreaming, or deranged. It is quite beyond
me, Mr. Force. This is my paper—I see it, and
know it—and this is an obituary notice of a living man
that I never put in there! I see and know that as well!
But how to reconcile these two contradictory facts, I
don’t know. How did you come by that paper, if you
please?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was sent to me by mail!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, well, well!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you a file of the Angleton <cite>Advertiser</cite>?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I have, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let us look at it, then, and compare this paper with
the paper of that same date on the file.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, that is a good idea. And I shall only have to
look at the copy of August 20th in last year’s file. I’ll
do it at once.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The editor turned and took down a roller full of
papers from the two wooden pins on the wall behind
him, and laid it upon the counter and began to turn
over the sheets.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here it is!” exclaimed Purdy, pulling out a paper
and spreading it out on the counter. “August 20th—and
appears to be a facsimile of the one you brought
here, sir. Now let us lay them on the board side by side
and compare them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He took the file and hung it up again on the wall, to
make room on the counter. Then he spread out the two
papers side by side, with their first pages uppermost.</p>

<p class='c008'>As he did so the boy who had been folding and wrapping
papers at the other end of the counter left his work
and crept toward the two men.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! see this!” exclaimed the proprietor—“see this!
The two papers are facsimile in every letter and line,
except in two places! See this! The first column on
the first page of the paper from the file is occupied by
the report of an agricultural fair at Middlemoor, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>the same column in the same edition of the paper, in the
copy you brought, is filled with the obituary of Col.
Anglesea! And here! In the list of deaths on another
page, the first paragraph in this paper from the file is
a notice of the death of the Rev. Mr. Orton, our old
vicar; and in the copy of the same paper that you
brought me the same space is taken up with the notice
of the death of Col. Anglesea. This is a very great
mystery!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps if you could recall all the incidents of the
day on which this paper was issued we might come to
some solution of the problem,” suggested Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know that I could,” replied Purdy.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Father,” said the boy—“father, I remember something
queer about that very day—I do.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXXV<br /> <span class='large'>A SECRET WITNESS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“You do? Come here, my son.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The lad came up to the counter. He was a fine, wholesome-looking
boy of about fifteen years of age, with a
fresh complexion, blue eyes, and closely cut, light brown
hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>He bowed to the visitors and stood waiting for his
father’s questions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You say you remember something about the twentieth
of last August?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, I ought to, father, because it was something
that happened unexpectedly that day that caused me to
be promoted from being a mere ’prentice in the printing
room to being your helper here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! Ah! Let me see! That was—yes—the day I
took you into the office was the day Norton absconded,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>for his sudden desertion left me in the lurch. And so,
Mr. Force,” said the editor, turning to his visitor, “I
took my lad here, who had been learning to be a printer,
on to help me. It was only as a temporary accommodation
of myself to circumstances that I took him, for I
intended to look up another assistant, but he proved himself
so capable that I have kept him on ever since, and
saved the expense of a journeyman.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah!” breathed Mr. Force, while Wynnette and
Leonidas bent eagerly forward to listen for further developments
of the mystery.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Won’t the young lady take a chair?” said Mr.
Purdy; for the party had been standing the whole time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Leonidas drew the only chair in sight from the back
of the passage between the counter and the wall, and
Wynnette bowed, and seated herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Could there have been any connection between the
insertion of that fraudulent notice and the sudden flight
of your foreman?” inquired Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Looks like it,” said the editor, still being much
puzzled. Then, turning to his son, he inquired:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Obed, do you think you can throw any light on this
mystery? You know what we are talking about, of
course. You heard what this gentleman has been telling
me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, father.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, do you remember anything more about the
events of that day—the last that Norton was here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, father. And the more I think about it now,
the better I understand things that I didn’t think much
of at the time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What were these things, Obed?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes!” involuntarily muttered Mr. Force. “What?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette and Leonidas almost held their breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>Obed told his story:</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know, father, when the last paper was taken off
the press that twentieth of August, Norton and I didn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>go to distributing the type, either of us, but both came
into the front office at your call to help to fold and direct
the papers, because the edition was a large one on account
of the agricultural fair. You remember that,
father?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, now you remind me of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And when the papers were all dispatched it was
nearly dark, and you went home, leaving Norton and
myself to close up. The type was not distributed, but
left, as it often was, till the next day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Our paper is a weekly, as you, perhaps, know, sir,”
interpolated the editor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force bowed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The boy continued, now addressing the whole party:</p>

<p class='c008'>“After father went out Norton said to me—and I
remembered how surprised I was at his sudden kindness,
though it did not arouse my suspicion of anything
wrong—he said to me:</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘You needn’t stop to-night, old man. I reckon I can
clear up the counter and shut up the office.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“So I went home to supper, and told father that Norton
had let me off. You remember that, father?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Y-y-yes, now you remind me of it. But I don’t
think I should remember it even now if the event were
not marked by the fact that I never saw Norton from
that night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“After supper,” continued the boy, “I went out to
walk. The village street is always very gay on Saturday
night. All the mill hands have got their week’s
wages and are abroad, buying for Sunday, and the shops
are gay. I stayed out just to see them until the custom
began to drop off and the shutters to be put up. And
then I started for home.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You needn’t think, sir, by that that my lad is the
least bit wild. Obed is as steady as a lamp-post, but
after being shut up in the office all day he must pull
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>himself out a little by taking a walk, even though it is
night. I tell him to,” Mr. Purdy explained.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Quite right,” assented Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>Obed continued:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, father, comes the strange part, which I didn’t
think much of at the time, but a great deal of now!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Go on, my boy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“When I came in sight of our printing office it was
all closed up, the heavy shutters up and the iron bars
across them; but I saw a glimmer of light through the
chinks, and my first thought was fire, and I ran around
to the back and climbed over the wall and looked through
a hole that I knew was in the shutter of the back window,
and there I saw——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes! yes!” exclaimed the editor, impatiently, as
the boy had only stopped to clear his throat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There I saw Norton as busy setting type as if the
making up of the paper was behindhand and he was
working against time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah!” breathed Abel Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The gas jet was burning right in front of him, shining
on his face and on his work so I could see him
quite plainly. I thought maybe he had some job to do,
and so it was all right; but just then a man came out of
the shadows of the room somewhere and leaned over
him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who was it? Col. Anglesea?” hastily demanded
Abel Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>Obed stared, and then replied, somewhat indignantly:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Col. Anglesea? Not likely, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What sort of a man was it?” inquired Mr. Purdy,
by way of diversion from the Anglesea question.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He was a gentleman, I should think, though,” said
the boy, apologetically. “He was a rather short, stout
man with a red face and light hair. I saw that much,
for when he went up to Norton the gas jet shone on him
also, and I could see him plainly. He spoke with Norton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>for a few minutes, and then went back somewhere
into the darkness. I thought maybe it was some one
who wanted some little job of labels printed and Norton
was doing it for him. So I came away and went home.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Was that all?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not quite. When we went to the office on Monday
we found it closed, though it was Norton’s place to have
opened it an hour before. Father and I opened it, and
I went to the press to begin to distribute the type, and
found——”</p>

<p class='c008'>The boy stopped to clear his throat again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, yes, what did you find, my lad?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, that the first two columns of the first page
were distributed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wasn’t surprised at that a bit, and I never thought
anything else about it but that he—Norton—had already
begun to distribute the type, and had got that far
and stopped. The rest of the type looked just as it had
been set. Father and I distributed the rest.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“See how it is now, so far as the act goes; but I can
see no motive for it,” said the editor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do not know much about printing,” remarked Abel
Force; “but was it not likely that on the Saturday night,
when you and your son had gone home, leaving the press
and the type just as the last copy of the paper had been
taken from it, was it not possible that this man Norton
may have distributed the type that had been set up for
the report of the agricultural fair which had been struck
off, and then set up this fraudulent obituary notice and
substituted it for the distributed matter, and then struck
off a few more copies of the paper?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir; and that is just what has been done. But
the motive, the motive, that’s what puzzles me,” exclaimed
the editor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The motive was to spread a false report of Col. Anglesea’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>death in America, where he had incurred some
personal liabilities,” replied Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>John Purdy stared.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In America—Col. Anglesea—liabilities? I think
you must be mistaken, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps.” Mr. Force did not wish to get into a
discussion; he wished to get information. “Have you
any idea who the man could have been who was in your
printing office on that night?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not the least in the world, sir, except that it was not
Col. Anglesea. You take my word of honor for that.”
Mr. Force bowed. He thought the boy’s description
of the man who was in the office with the printer that
night tallied perfectly with the personal appearance of
Anglesea as he had known him, but he did not say so;
he shunned disputes, so as to get facts.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where was Col. Anglesea at this time?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Col. the Hon. Angus Anglesea, of Anglewood
Manor, was at his home. He was soon after appointed
deputy lieutenant of the county,” replied Purdy, with
some vicarious dignity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where is he now?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Abroad—traveling for his health, I think.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And—this man Norton, who must have set up the
fraudulent obituary, where is he?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nobody knows. He never returned to the office. I
never saw him, or heard of him again. His was one of
the cases of ‘Mysterious Disappearance,’ and as such it
was noticed in all the local papers. All had different
theories. The Middlemoor <cite>Messenger</cite> thought that he
had been made away with by pitmen. The wretched pitmen
get blamed for all the undiscovered crime in the
county. They live mostly in darkness, and so people
seem to believe that they ‘love darkness rather than light
because their deeds are evil.’ But this is not so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And no clew was ever discovered to the fate of Norton?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>“None, sir. You see he was a single man, without
any near relations, and so the affair was soon forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” said Abel Force, straightening himself up,
“I thank you for the information you have given me,
and the opportunity you have afforded us of comparing
the fraudulent paper with that of the same date on your
file. This is your mailing day, and I must not detain
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come in at any time, sir; we shall be glad to see
you. Making any stay in this place, sir?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you. No, only over the Sabbath. Good-day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-day, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Le,” said Mr. Force, as they re-entered the carriage,
“we are on the track of the fraud, but need not pursue
it in the direction of that man and boy. Now we will
see what the tombstones have to tell us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where to now, maister?” inquired the driver, from
his seat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To Anglewood Church, Anglewood Manor,” said
Mr. Force.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXXVI<br /> <span class='large'>ANGLEWOOD OLD CHURCH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Leaving the office of the Angleton <cite>Advertiser</cite>,
and turning up the village street, they repassed the
blacksmith’s, the general dealer’s, the doctor’s surgery,
the lawyer’s office, the post office, the news agency, and
finally the Angleton Arms—an ancient hostelry, built of
stone, with strong walls, peaked roof, high chimney and
low, broad, latticed windows—which stood as on guard
at the entrance of the hamlet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Leaving the place at this point, they entered the road
leading to Anglewood Manor.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>No pleasant, shady, grass-bordered country road was
this, with vistas of woods and waters, fields and farms.
It was a white and arid highway, running between gray
stone walls, whose dread monotony was varied only by
the occasional branch of a tree over their tops, or of an
iron gate, or oaken door, in the sides.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whose property is this on the right and left of us?”
inquired Mr. Force of the driver.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thet on t’ roight, maister, be Middlemoor, t’ seat o’
t’ Arl o’ Middlemoor. Thet on t’ left be Fell Hall, t’
seat o’ Squoire Ogden,” replied the man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What hateful roads!” exclaimed Wynnette. “I feel
exactly as if we were driving on between a madhouse
and a jail!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They were slowly going uphill now, and presently
came to a lane on the left, into which the carriage
turned. Still on the left of the new way was the low
stone wall, but behind and above it was a green hedge
of Osage orange bushes, while opposite, on the right, was
a lovely green hedge of all the variety of bushes and
brambles that grow outdoors in that part of England.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is better,” said Wynnette, as they drove slowly
on between the green hedges.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We be noo at back o’ Fell Hall. And yon’s t’ steeple
o’ t’ church,” the coachman volunteered to explain, as
he pointed to the spire which rose above a clump of trees
on their left.</p>

<p class='c008'>They soon reached the entrance of the churchyard
and passed in.</p>

<p class='c008'>The church stood on an eminence, which they had
been gradually climbing all the way from Angleton.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a very picturesque building of ancient English
type—moss-grown and ivy-covered from base to pinnacle,
until not a bit of its walls or roof could be seen.
Many ancient gravestones, gray with age, sunk in long
grass and covered with moss, clustered around it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is the church open to visitors?” inquired Mr. Force
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>of the driver, as they drew up to the closed and formidable-looking,
iron-bound oaken doors.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oy, maister! It be t’ show o’ t’ place, be Anglewood
Old Church.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They all alighted from the rough carriage and stood
on the flagstones of the church porch, and looked around
them. The sun was in the west now, and shining on the
grass-grown yard and the moss-covered gravestones.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are any of the Anglesea family buried out here?”
inquired Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oot here? Laird, no, maister! They be all in t’
vault. And none ha’ been put into t’ groond here, even
of t’ common folk, in my toime! They be took to t’
simitry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“To the cemetery?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oy, maister, on t’ hill, over by yonder.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah! well! how are we to get into this building?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll rin and get the key fra’ m’ oncle, Silas Kirby, t’
sexton.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And don’t you know, papa, we have got that letter
and parcel from John Kirby to his father?” said Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, yes, my dear, I know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, then, may we not go to the sexton ourselves?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will see. How far is your uncle’s home from
here?” inquired Mr. Force of the driver.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whoy, joost by t’other gate o’ the churchyard,” replied
the man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then we will leave the carriage here and go across to
his house, to take something we have brought for your
grandfather,” said Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oy, oy! t’ letter Oi heerd t’ mawther talk aboot.
Coom along wi’ Oi, maister. This be the way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Leaving the old carriage standing before the church
door, the driver led the way through the long grass, and
in and out among the tombstones, taking care not to step
upon the graves, and so reached another gate opening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>upon a sequestered lane and flanked by two buildings,
one of which was the sexton’s cottage, built of stone, with
a steep roof, tall chimneys and latticed windows, and,
like the church, so moss-grown and ivy-covered that only
its doors and windows escaped the veil.</p>

<p class='c008'>A tall, venerable, white-haired man, with a long white
beard, sat in the door, smoking, and apparently meditating.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Grandfeyther,” said Jonah Kirby, addressing this
patriarch, “here be a gentleman from foreign pairts a
bringing of a letter and news from Uncle John.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eh! eh! then, what be ye talking aboot, lad?” inquired
the old man, rising with difficulty, balancing himself,
and bowing to the strangers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jonah Kirby repeated his introduction.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eh! My service to you, gentlefolks. A letter fra m’
lad in ’Merica! Eh! Laird bless us!—a letter fra m’
lad, quotha?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Mr. Kirby, my little girl here has brought you
a letter from your son, John Kirby, who is a baggage
master on a prosperous railroad in the United States.
She made his acquaintance on the train. Here, Wynnette,
my dear, give the old man his letter and parcel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The young girl handed both.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thanky, me leddy! Thanky koindly!” said the
patriarch, sinking back in his armchair; for between
age, weakness and emotion he was no longer able to
stand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And ’ee saw me lad? And ’ee brought me this letter
fra him? God bless ’ee, me leddy! God bless ’ee!”
said the old man, in an earnest voice which trembled
with agitation, as he took the girl’s hand, made as if he
would have kissed it, but pressed it to his forehead and
to his wet eyes instead—“God bless ’ee, me leddy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was all through the dog,” said Wynnette. “He
took care of my dear dog for me, and fed him on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>journey, and kept him from jumping off the train and
out of all danger.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oy! oy! John was ever good to animals, and varry
fond of dogs, was John. And t’ lad’s doing well, ye say,
me leddy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes. Read his letter,” said Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oy, oy, to be sure. Here, Silas—Silas, lad—here
be a letter fra furrin pairts, fra your brawther John.
Come hither, Silas—and bring chairs for t’ gentlefolks.
Ah! bad manners of me to be sitting while t’ gentlefolks
stand!” said the patriarch, striving to get upon his feet,
but failing, and sinking back.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pray do not disturb yourself,” said Mr. Force. “We
do not wish to sit down. We would like to see the inside
of the old church, if your son, the sexton, can show
it to us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of coorse he can, and thet just noo. Silas, Silas,
where be ye, and t’ gentlefolks waiting on ye?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A tall, robust, tawny-headed and bearded man came
out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here’s a letter fra your brawther as t’ gentlefolks ha’
brought fra furrin pairts. But ’ee can read it when ’ee
coom back. Gae, noo, and show t’ gentlefolks to Old
Church. Coom here, Katie, me lass, and read this letter
to thy auld grandad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This last speech was addressed to a fair-haired girl of
about sixteen, who appeared at the door and courtesied
to the strangers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Silas Kirby, the sexton, bowed to the visitors, and in
a few muffled words intimated his readiness to oblige
them, and walked on before, swinging a large key in
his hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he reached the church door he put the key in
the ponderous lock, turned it with a great twist, and
unlocked it with a loud noise.</p>

<p class='c008'>The travelers entered an obscurity of rich light and
shade from stained glass windows, half-hidden in ivy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>and glowing down upon dark oaken pews and tessellated
floor.</p>

<p class='c008'>When their eyes became accustomed to the semidarkness,
the travelers went up toward the chancel, and saw
the recumbent effigy of the founder of the family of
Anglesea, and memorial tablets of many of their descendants.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some little time was spent in reading the inscriptions
upon these monuments, and examining the paintings on
the walls between the windows; and then Mr. Force inquired:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is the monument of the late Lady Mary Anglesea in
this church?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Noa, maister; not in the church.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are her remains in the vault?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Loikely they be, maister. I ha’ not had occasion to
go into t’ vault since I coom to t’ parish.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you were no here when Lady Mary Anglesea
died, then?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Noa, maister, I were not. That were in Goodman
Prout’s time. But her leddyship will be loikely i’ t’
vault.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Saying this, the sexton took a key from his pocket
and unlocked a door on the right-hand side of the chancel,
revealing a narrow flight of stone steps leading into
the crypt below.</p>

<p class='c008'>All the party approached the opening.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wynnette, my dear, you had better not venture down.
The air must be very bad,” said Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nay, maister, none so bad as you think. There be
many a gentleman’s cellar far worse. There be windys—open
windys—wi’ airn bars on each side of the wall,
and on each end of the wall even wi’ the ground, and
though they be some of ’em well choked up, yet for all
that there be enough o’ them open to keep the air fresh
i’ the vault. There be na fear, maister,” said the sexton.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force, standing at the head of the steps leading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>down into the vault, felt for himself that there was no
fear of foul air; the atmosphere was as fresh, though a
little damper, than that of the church above.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sexton unhooked a lantern that hung on a nail
within the door, took a match from his pocket, lighted
the little lamp and walked before the visitors down the
steps.</p>

<p class='c008'>The vault occupied all the space under the church,
and it was provided with stone tables ranged around the
four walls.</p>

<p class='c008'>The place was dimly visible by the daylight which
struggled through the ivy that half choked up the barred
windows. This was strongest from the west, from which
the declining sun shot rays of golden light through bars
and ivy leaves, whose shadows flickered dimly on the
stone tables and on the leaden caskets they supported.</p>

<p class='c008'>But it needed the additional light of the lantern by
which to read the inscription on the latter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force began at the casket nearest the foot of the
stairs and read the name—Alexander d’Anglesay, 1250;
Malcolm d’Anglesay, A. D.—the rest worn out; Dame
Margery d’An—the rest illegible—see, 1090—the rest
gone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“On this side must be the oldest caskets; let us try the
other,” said Mr. Force, crossing over to the opposite row,
followed by the sexton carrying the lantern, and beginning
to read the inscriptions:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah! Richard Anglesea, born July 1, 1801, died
January 31, 1850; aged 49 years. Ah! that was the
father of an unworthy son! Fell gallantly at the head
of his regiment in the battle of——What is that you
say, Le?” Mr. Force broke off from his remarks to attend
to the words of his young companion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have looked at every casket, uncle! That of Lady
Mary Anglesea is not in the vault,” said the young man,
with a sigh of disappointment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not, Le! Are you sure?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>“Quite sure, uncle.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is not here, papa! I have looked at every one
with Le, and it is not among them,” added Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet Mr. Force would not be satisfied, but went round
to every casket, attended by the sexton carrying the lantern,
by the light of which they read every inscription,
or what was left of the inscription; but found no trace
of Lady Mary Anglesea.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We had as well give up the search here,” said Mr.
Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And where else should we look?” inquired Le, with
a face of despair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The only other possible place will be the churchyard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, her leddyship will not be there, maister! Nabody
has been interred there this many a year. T’ parish
officers will na’ allow it! They all go to t’ simitry on
t’ hill. Let alone one o’ t’ great family as never was
buried in t’ open churchyard! Oh! But noo I moind
me, maister!” exclaimed the man, with a sudden lightening
of his face.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?” demanded Abel Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And what a gey coote I was to forget it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?” again inquired Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it was all along of my thinking as you wanted
to see t’ auld church, and not the leddy’s munniment,
as put me off the track,” continued the man.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force said no more, but waited for the sexton to
explain himself in his own way.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Her leddyship’s body must be in t’ grand new musselman
as the squire had built to her memory. Eh,
maister, I were not i’ the parish when t’ bootiful leddy
deed; but the folk do say he took on a soight! Shet himself
up in t’ hoose after t’ funeral and wouldn’t see a
soul! Had the foine musselman built in the park and
her laid in it! And then he betook hisself to
furrin pairts and never come home for years! Bother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>my wooden head for not telling you first off; but you see,
maister, I thought it was t’ auld church you wanted and
not the leddy’s munnimint.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where is”—Abel Force could scarcely bring himself
to utter the detested name—“where is Col. Anglesea
now?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Traveling, maister, in furrin lands. He coom home
aboot a year ago, and he was ’pointed leevetinint o’ t’
county. But he couldn’t abide the manor since her
leddyship deed, and so he resigned and went away
again. Eh, but he loved the ground she walked on, and
couldn’t abear it after she deed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force, Wynnette and Leonidas listened to this
with surprise and incredulity. This was, indeed, a new
view of Angus Anglesea’s character.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can the mausoleum in the park be seen?” inquired
Abel Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Varry loikely, maister. T’ whole place can be seen,
for t’ matter of that. T’ squoire let open t’ whole manor,
hall and a’, to a’ that loike to look at it. A free-hairted
and free-handed gentleman be our squoire.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Here was another revelation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you be our guide to the new mausoleum?” inquired
Abel Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ay, maister. I’ll walk over and speak to the keeper,
Proby, and meet you at t’ musselman. Jonah will drive
you over, maister. He knows t’ way as well as I do
myself.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXXVII<br /> <span class='large'>THE TOMB’S EVIDENCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>They crossed the churchyard again and entered the
carriage. Jonah mounted the box.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Noo drive the gentlefolks to t’ east o’ t’ park, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>roond by the musselman. I’ll cut across through t’
brush and speak to t’ keeper, and meet you there. It
will be all roight, maister.”</p>

<p class='c008'>With this the sexton struck off through the bushes
that stood between the church and the manor house.</p>

<p class='c008'>The old carriage left the churchyard by the way it
had come and entered once more upon the lane, and turning
eastward, drove on between green hedges for about
a quarter of a mile, when it reached a massive gate of
oak and iron, guarded by a porter’s lodge of stone in the
same strong style of building as the sexton’s cottage at
the churchyard wall.</p>

<p class='c008'>A tidy woman come out of the lodge, and seeing the
old carriage, with Jonah on the box, she smiled and
nodded, and at once opened wide the gates.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Any one at the manor house, Mistress Dillon?” inquired
Jonah.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Noa, lad; none but t’ housekeeper and t’ servants,”
replied the woman, courtesying to “the gentlefolks” as
the old carriage passed through the gate and entered the
long avenue leading through the park to the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>This avenue was shaded by rows of gigantic old oak
trees on each side, whose branches met and intermingled
overhead, so arching the way with a thick roof of foliage.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, what a beautiful—what a majestic vista!” exclaimed
Wynnette, with more enthusiasm than she
usually bestowed upon any object.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is very fine,” said her father. “There is nothing
finer in their way than these old English parks.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently the carriage turned with the avenue in a
curve, and suddenly drew up before the manor house,
which until that moment had been concealed by the
lofty trees around it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anglesea Manor was a huge oblong building of some
gray stone, supported at its corners by four square towers,
each further strengthened by four turrets, all of
which added to the architectural beauty of the edifice.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>There were three rows of lofty windows in the front.
The lowest row was divided in the middle by massive
oaken doors, opening upon a stone platform reached by
seven stone steps.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh-h-h!” breathed Wynnette, as she gazed on the fine
old house. “To think that such a palace as this should
be the inheritance of such a villain as he!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The driver turned and looked at her with astonishment
and some indignation. Then checking himself, he
said, in perfect simplicity:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oo! you don’t know, young leddy, I reckon—this
place belongs to our landlord, Col. Angus Anglesea.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then drawing up his horse, he inquired:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Will you get out and go through the house, sir?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“For Heaven’s sake, uncle, no—not yet. Let us go
directly to the mausoleum, and see the date that is on
the tomb, and solve this doubt that is intolerable,”
pleaded Le.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well, my dear boy; very well. Kirby, drive at
once to the mausoleum. We will see the house later,”
said Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man touched his hat and started his horse.</p>

<p class='c008'>They turned into a grass-grown road winding in and
out among magnificent oaks that seemed the growth of
many centuries, and that were probably once parts of
the primeval forest of Britain.</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently they came upon the mausoleum. It stood
between two fine oak trees, and in front of a third, which
formed its background. It was built in the form of a
Grecian temple and surrounded by a silver-plated iron
railing.</p>

<p class='c008'>The carriage stopped and our tourists got out.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le pushed on impetuously, opened the little gate, and
stepped up to read the inscription on the marble. He
read it attentively, stopped, gazed at it, read it again,
and then turned away in silence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it, Le?” anxiously inquired Abel Force.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>“It is—read it, uncle,” replied the young man, breaking
down and turning away.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force entered the inclosure and read the inscription
on the mausoleum:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mary</span>,</div>
    <div>Beloved Wife of <span class='sc'>Angus Anglesea</span>,</div>
    <div>Died August 25, 18—,</div>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aged</span> 49.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force turned away without a word.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette entered the inclosure, read the inscription
and came out in perfect silence.</p>

<p class='c008'>The driver of the old carriage and the sexton of the
church, who had only just now kept his promise and
come up to join the party, stood a little apart, not understanding
the emotion of the strangers, attributed it all
to sympathy with the bereaved husband.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oo, ay, maister, it was a sorrowful day when her
leddyship departed this loife,” said Jonah Kirby, shaking
his head—“a sorrowful day! I was at t’ funeral, as
in duty bound. T’ squoire were first mourner, and hed
to be present, though he were far from fit to stand.
Laird Middlemoor, his feyther-in-law, hed to hold him
up. I never saw t’ squoire from the day of t’ funeral until
the day he took t’ train for Lunnun, when he were
going abroad to furrin pairts. And then he had gone
away to nothing but skin and bone! He came back
about a year ago; but he couldn’t abear the place, and
went away again. Ah, poor gentleman!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Le and his uncle looked at each other in wonder. Was
this Angus Anglesea of whom the man was speaking?
who had reared this monument to the memory of his
“beloved wife”? Was this Angus Anglesea, whom
every one praised? And yet, who had gone abroad and
deceived, betrayed, and robbed and deserted the poor
Californian widow? And how, indeed, could he have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>married the Californian woman in St. Sebastian, on the
first of August, as Le had unquestionable evidence that
he had done, and be present at the death of his wife in
the English manor house on the twenty-fifth of the same
month, as these people declared that he had been; and,
again, meet the Force family at Niagara early in the
following September? It might have been just possible
by almost incredibly rapid transits.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Had Col. Anglesea been abroad just before his wife’s
death?” inquired Abel Force of the driver, who knew
more about the affairs of Anglewood than the sexton,
because the former had always lived at Angleton, and
the latter had only lately come to the parish.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oo, ay, maister, thet was the pity o’ ’t. The squoire
hed been away a month or more. He coom home only a
week before her leddyship deed. And he went away
again after t’ funeral. He coom back again a year ago,
but he couldn’t abear to stay. So he put up t’ musselman
to her memory and went his way again. Ah, poor
gentleman! He were a good gentleman, and a wise and
a brave one!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I cannot make it out,” murmured Abel Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The man is drawing a long bow, papa! that’s all
there is in it—I mean he is telling romances in praise
of his landlord. There cannot be a word of truth in
what he says,” said Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le said nothing. He seemed utterly crushed by the
blow that had fallen on him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The carriage driver seemed not to hear or understand
the murmured talk between the father and daughter,
but when it ceased he touched his hat and asked:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wull I drive you to t’ manor house, noo, maister?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, if you please,” returned Mr. Force, as he helped
Wynnette to climb up into the dilapidated “trap.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And what do your honor think o’ t’ musselman,
maister?” inquired the sexton, coming up and taking off
his cap.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>“It is a very fine specimen of both architecture and
sculpture,” replied Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sexton smiled satisfaction, bowed and withdrew.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am puzzled, Le, and I think by going through the
manor house I may come to understand things better,”
whispered Mr. Force to his young companion.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Le was too much depressed to answer, or to take
any further interest in the events of the day.</p>

<p class='c008'>They turned and drove back through the beautiful
park to the front of the manor house, where the carriage
drew up.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

</div>

<p class='c007'>“If you will give me leave, maister, I’ll go roond and
speak to Mistress Bolton, t’ hoosekeeper, and get her to
coom and open t’ great door,” said Jonah Kirby, as he
got down from his seat and struck into a flagged walk
that led to the rear of the house.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Le! Le! don’t look so down-hearted, dear boy! Remember,
come what may, my daughter shall never be
the wife of Angus Anglesea! Come, come, cheer up,
lad!” said Abel Force, clapping his young companion on
the back.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Le’s only answer was a profound sigh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think the best and shortest way out of our difficulty
will be to go back to America, have that man prosecuted
for bigamy and robbery, and sent to the State prison,
and then have him divorced, if, indeed, he has any claim
whatever on Odalite. And I don’t see why you don’t
take that way,” said Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because, my dearest dear,” answered her father, “to
prosecute the man would be to bring our darling Odalite’s
name into too much publicity. And, as for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>divorce, the very word is an offense to right-minded people.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is better than——”</p>

<p class='c008'>But whatever Wynnette was about to say was cut
short by the loud, harsh turning of a key, and the noisy
opening of the great door of Anglewood Manor House.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jonah Kirby appeared, accompanied by altogether
the very largest woman our travelers had ever seen in
their lives, even at a traveling circus.</p>

<p class='c008'>She appeared to be about forty years old, and was
dressed in a very full, light blue calico skirt, and loose
basque of the same, that made her look even larger than
she was. She wore a high-crowned, book-muslin cap,
with a broad, blue ribbon around it. She carried in her
hand a formidable bunch of keys.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’s ‘fearfully and wonderfully’ huge, papa. And
she will expect a crown, and, maybe, half a guinea, for
showing the house,” said Wynnette, in a low tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>By this time Jonah Kirby had come down the steps
and up to the side of the carriage.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mrs. Bolton, maister, and she’ll show t’ hoose with
pleasure. She always loikes to oblige t’ gentlefolks, she
bed me say.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Papa, it must be half a guinea, and don’t you forget!”
whispered Wynnette, as she gave her hand to
Kirby and allowed him to help her out of the carriage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force and Le followed, and they all walked up
the steps, to be met by the enormous woman in blue,
with many courtesies.</p>

<p class='c008'>She led them at once into a vast stone hall, whose
walls were hung with ancient armor, battle-axes, crossbows,
lances and other insignia of war; and with horns,
bugles, antlers, weapons and trophies of the chase, and
whose tessellated floor was covered with the skins of
wild animals. From the center of this hall a magnificent
flight of stairs ascended, in large, spiral circles,
to the stained glass skylight in the roof.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>There were handsome doors of solid oak on either
side.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Bolton paused in the middle of the hall and said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“The doors on the right lead into the justice room,
and the long dining room; those on the left into the ballroom,
which is the largest room, three times told, in the
house. There is nothing on this floor very interesting
except the antique furniture and the curiously carved
woodwork of the chimney pieces and doors.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She spoke like a guide book, but presently added:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some gentlefolks, if they have a heap of time, like
to look through them, but many prefer the picture gallery
and the library, and the drawing rooms, which are
all on the floor above and all very handsome.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We will go upstairs first, if you please; later, if we
have time, we will see the rooms down here,” said Abel
Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>The housekeeper led the way upstairs to the next landing,
where they came out upon the hall, whose walls were
hung with antique tapestry, and whose oaken floor was
covered here and there with Persian rugs.</p>

<p class='c008'>On every side handsome mahogany double doors led
into apartments. Before every door lay a rich Persian
rug.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Bolton opened a door on the left.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The picture gallery, ladies and gentlemen,” she said,
using her formula, though there was but one lady present.</p>

<p class='c008'>They entered a long, lofty room lighted from the roof.
The walls were hung with many pictures, so dark and
dim with age that even the good light failed to make
their meanings intelligible to the spectators. Yet these
were considered the most valuable in the whole collection,
and the housekeeper, with great pride, gave the
history of each, in something like this style:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Martyrdom of St. Stephen, ladies and gentlemen—painted
by Leonardo da Vinci, in the year of our Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>1480, purchased at Milan in 1700 for five thousand
guineas, by Ralph d’Anglesea of Anglewood. A very
rare picture, no copy of it being in existence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Our party looked up and saw in a heavy, gilded
frame, about five feet square, a very dark, murky canvas,
with a small smirch in the middle—nothing more.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was only a sample of a score of other priceless
paintings, invisible as to forms and unintelligible as to
meanings, which the housekeeper introduced to the visitors
with much pride in the showing.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, ladies and gentlemen, we come to the family
portraits,” said Mrs. Bolton, passing under a lofty archway
adorned by the Anglesea arms, and leading the
visitors into another compartment of the same gallery.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here, ladies and gentlemen, is a portrait of Kenneth
d’Anglesea, year 800; very old.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Our party looked at it and thought it was “very old”—a
long brown smudge crowned with an oval yellow
smudge, all in a very dark ground, and supposed to
represent a human form—no more.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And here, ladies and gentlemen, is Ethus d’Anglesea,
year 950—also old.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Again the visitors agreed with the housekeeper. The
figure was old and almost invisible.</p>

<p class='c008'>And so she went through a dozen or more of these
earlier family portraits, and came down at last to later
periods, to crusaders in the reign of Richard the Lion-hearted,
by gradations down to courtiers in the reign of
Elizabeth, to cavaliers in the reigns of the unfortunate
Stuarts, to gallants in the reigns of the Georges, and
finally down to the ladies and gentlemen of the reign of
Queen Victoria.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here, sir, is an excellent portrait of our present master,
Col. Angus Anglesea, and of his late lamented lady,”
said the housekeeper, pausing before two full length portraits
that hung side by side, like companion pictures,
at the end of the gallery.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>Our travelers paused before the pictures and gazed
at them in silence for some moments.</p>

<p class='c008'>The portrait of Col. Anglesea was a very striking
likeness. All our party recognized it at once as such.</p>

<p class='c008'>But how was this? Here was the form, face and complexion,
perfect to a curve of figure, perfect to a shade
of color; yet the expression was different. For whereas
the expression of Anglesea’s face, as our friends had
known it, was either joyous, morose, or defiant, the
character of this face was grave, thoughtful and benevolent.
Yet it was certainly the portrait of Angus Anglesea.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette perceived the perplexity on the brows of her
companions and whispered:</p>

<p class='c008'>“A two-faced, double-dealing as well as double-dyed,
villain, papa! A sanctimonious hypocrite at home and
a brawling ruffian abroad!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should scarcely take this to be the face of a hypocrite,
my dear, or of any other than of a good, wise and
brave man; yet—yet it is all very strange.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then they looked at the portrait of Lady Mary Anglesea,
at which they had only glanced before.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the counterfeit presentment of a lady whose
beauty, or rather the special character of whose beauty,
at once riveted attention.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was that of a tall, well-formed though rather delicate
woman, with sweet, pale, oval face, tender, serious
brown eyes, and soft, rippling brown hair that strayed
in little, careless ringlets about her forehead and temples,
adding to the exquisite sweetness and pathos of the
whole presence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What a beautiful, beautiful creature! What lovely,
lovely eyes!” breathed Wynnette, gazing at the picture.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, young lady,” said the housekeeper, “and as good
and wise as she was beautiful. And when the lovely
eyes closed on this world, be sure they opened in heaven.
And when the beautiful form was laid in the tomb all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>the light seemed to have gone out of this world for us!
It nearly killed the master. And no wonder—no wonder!”
said Mrs. Bolton, drawing a large pocket handkerchief,
that would have answered for a small tablecloth,
from her pocket and wiping her eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again Abel Force and Leonidas looked at each other.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, yes! They were a handsome pair!” said the
housekeeper, with a sigh that raised her mighty bosom
as the wind raises the ocean—“a very handsome pair,
and the parting of ’em has been  nigh the death of the
colonel,” she added, as she replaced her handkerchief
in her pocket.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And yet I have heard that he married again while
he was abroad,” Mr. Force could not refrain from saying.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He!” exclaimed Mrs. Bolton, in a tone of indignant
astonishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes; there is no law against a widower marrying, is
there?” replied Abel Force, quietly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He! he marry again! Oh, sir, you are mistaken!
He was more likely to die than to marry! Whoever told
you so, sir—begging your pardon—told a most haynious
falsehood!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I really hope he never did marry again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He never did, sir, and he never will. He is true to
her memory, and he lives only for their son, who is at
Eton. Now, sir, shall I show you the library and the
drawing rooms?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force bowed, and with his party followed the
housekeeper from the picture gallery to the hall and
through that to the drawing rooms, into which they only
looked, for the apartment was fitted up in modern style
and all the furniture shrouded in brown holland.</p>

<p class='c008'>The library was more interesting, and contained
many rare black-letter tomes, into which Abel Force
would have liked to look, had time allowed.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>The sun was setting and it was growing dusk in this
grand and gloomy mansion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We must go now, I think, my dear,” said Mr. Force,
in a low voice, to his daughter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette drew him quite away from the group into
the light of the great oriel window of the library and
whispered:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not a crown, nor a half sov., but a guinea, papa!
a whole guinea for all those thundering bouncers—I
mean those romances she has told us about the jolly old
smoke-dried window shades and fire screens hung up in
frames for pictures of the ancestors, and called Kenneths
and Ethuses and things! Why, papa, those
couldn’t have been portraits! There were no painters
in Britain at the time those are said to have lived. And
then about the Leonardo da Vinci picture! If he ever
painted that it would be in one of the great art galleries
of the world! Not in a private collection! Give her a
guinea, papa! She can’t afford to lie so much for less!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear, the woman only repeats what she has
heard,” said Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>They rejoined Le and the housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force thanked the good woman for her attention
and left a generous remuneration in her hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>She courtesied and then saw them downstairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the hall below she pointed out the full suits of
armor worn by this or that knight in such or such a battle;
and the antlers of the stag killed by this or that
huntsman, in such or such a chase.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Would your honor now like to look into the ballroom,
or the long dining room, or justice room?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, thank you; it is getting late. We have to return
to Angleton,” replied Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then each of the party, in turn, again thanked
the housekeeper for the pleasure she had given them and
took leave of her.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXXIX<br /> <span class='large'>“SMUGGLERY”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Papa, dear,” said Wynnette as she re-entered the dilapidated
carriage, “we must go to the sexton’s cottage
to bid good-by to the old man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, my dear. Kirby, go back to your father’s cottage
before we turn into the highroad,” said Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>The carriage rattled on, and in a short time drew up
before the sexton’s lodge at the great gate of the churchyard.</p>

<p class='c008'>The old man still sat before the door; but he was
smoking, and his bald head and long white beard were
enveloped in smoke.</p>

<p class='c008'>He took the pipe from his mouth the instant he heard
the sound of wheels and he held out his hand to welcome
Wynnette as she ran up to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, my little leddy; I ha’ read the lad’s letter! Ah!
I do get a letter by mail fra’ ’m coome the first week on
every month! But a letter brought by a leddy’s hand
and she ha’ seen him face to face mayhap within a
month! Ah! but that’s better!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have seen your son and shaken hands with him,
and talked to him for hours, within twenty-three days,”
said Wynnette, after making a rapid calculation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eh, now! is thet possible?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I rode on his train all day on the twenty-sixth of
May, two days before we sailed for England. And this,
you know, is the eighteenth of June.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eh, then! look at thet, noo! Only in twenty-three
days! He’s not thet far away, after all, is he, me
leddy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no. Why, it’s nothing! Only across ‘the big
herring pond,’ you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The old man stared helplessly.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>“That is what they call it for fun, because it is such
a little matter to go across it. Why, people say to each
other when they meet on the deck of a steamer: ‘Going
across?’ And another will say: ‘Not to-day.’ So you
see what a trifle it is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So it must be, indeed, me little leddy. And your
words ha’ comforted me more than the counsels of his
reverence. Such a little thing! ‘Go across?’ ‘Not to-day.’
Yes, that is a comfort. And the good ’bacco is
another comfort. The ’bacco was in the parcel you
brought me, me leddy; and you couldn’t get such ’bacco
as this—no, not for love, nor yet for money—not if you
was a dying for ’t! Why, the Yarl o’ Middlemoor
would be proud to smoke sich ’bacco—I know he would!
It must ha’ cost a power o’ money! I reckon my lad be
getting rich over yonder, to send his feyther sich ’bacco
as this. And the duty on’t must a been staggering
loike!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Here Wynnette started. She had not seen any duty
paid on that tobacco; nor, indeed, had the custom house
officers at Liverpool seen the tobacco; but she had not
even thought of this before.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And yet I ha’ a greater comfort even than this ’bacco
as is fit for the Turkey of All Constantinople to smoke.
My lad writes as he is coming over with his missus to
see me next autumn. Thet’s the crooning comfort, me
leddy—thet’s the crooning comfort!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnete now took leave of the old man, and returned
to her seat in the carriage.</p>

<p class='c008'>He arose with difficulty and stood up, bowing to the
party, while Mr. Force and Le raised their hats as the
carriage drove off.</p>

<p class='c008'>They returned upon their way, repassed the front of
the old manor house, now again closed up and gloomy,
turned into the oak avenue, and in a few minutes came
to the great gate, which was opened by Mrs. Dillon, the
keeper of the lodge.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>She smiled and courtesied as the old carriage passed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le, who was nearest to her, reached out his hand and
dropped a piece of silver in her palm.</p>

<p class='c008'>She courtesied again. The carriage turned into the
highroad and began the journey back to Angleton.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sun had set, and even the afterglow had faded
from the western horizon; yet still the long twilight of
summer nights in these latitudes prevailed, and the
greater stars shone out one by one as they rattled on,
uphill and downhill, over the rolling moor, until at last
they came in view of the lights in the quiet village.</p>

<p class='c008'>In ten minutes they entered the street, and passed
under the archway of the Anglesea Arms, the hungriest
and weariest set of travelers who had ever entered that
ancient hostelry.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jonah jumped from his seat and secured his horse.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force alighted and handed out Wynnette. Le
followed them. He had scarcely spoken a word since
leaving the mausoleum.</p>

<p class='c008'>The landlady came out to meet them, in her Sunday
gown of black silk, and a new cap.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope as you’ve hed a pleasant day, sir,” she said to
Mr. Force, who was the first to meet her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you, madam. We have had a very hungry
day, at any rate; and, if you please, we would like just
such a spread as you gave us last evening,” replied Abel
Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You shall have it, sir. It will be on the table in
twenty minutes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>By this time they had reached the parlor and Mr.
Force was pulling off his gloves, when Wynnette said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Papa, I shall run up to my room and take off my
things, and wash my face, but I will be back in a little
while.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette vanished.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force sat down in the large armchair.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Le stood at the window and stared out at nothing
whatever.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jonah, in a clean white apron, and the official towel
thrown over his arm, came in, offered Mr. Force the
Angleton <cite>Advertiser</cite>, and then began to pull and stretch
the perfectly smooth tablecloth this way and that to show
his zeal.</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently he went out, and Wynnette returned to the
room.</p>

<p class='c008'>She glanced around, and, seeing no one present but
her two companions, drew a chair to her father’s side,
threw herself into it and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, papa! I have been aching and burning and
throbbing to tell you something, but could not get a
chance, because that man was always present, and I was
afraid he might inform on us and get us arrested, and I
didn’t know what the penalty might be—imprisonment
and penal servitude, perhaps. But, for all that, I am
delighted—perfectly beside myself with delight!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are you talking of, Wynnette, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here comes that man again. We must be cautious,
though I could dance in triumph,” said Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>At this moment Jonah re-entered the parlor with an
ample waiter, on which were piled the china, glass and
cutlery, with which he hastened to set the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he had left the room again Wynnette continued
in a mysterious whisper:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Papa, I have committed smugglery.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Smugglery,’ my dear. There’s no such word.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, then, there ought to be, and henceforth there
is. I was born to enrich the language, and—to commit
smugglery. And I am proud and delighted! But I
should have been ever so much prouder and no end to
be delighted if I had intended to commit. But, ah me!
It was an accident. ‘Some are born great; some achieve
greatness; and some have greatness thrust upon them,’
and others become great by accident. Such is my case.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>“You rattle-trap, what are you talking about?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Smuggling, papa! That parcel I brought to old Mr.
Kirby contained a tin box of choice tobacco, and the
duty is higher, and the excise law stringent, and we never
paid a cent!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force looked aghast, and then burst into a laugh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How did it happen, Wynnette?” he inquired, when
he had done laughing. “I did not know the thing was
tobacco.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No more did I! I wish I had! But I didn’t. And
the officer searched all our trunks, and all our bags, and
I carried that parcel in my hand, and he never even
looked at it! Oh! I am so proud of having smuggled
that tobacco! I wish I had intended it! But, henceforth,
I do intend it! I mean to smuggle every time I
can get a chance—not for any profit to myself, but for
the principle of the thing! The Lord never made the
excise laws and so my conscience is not bound by them.
And I never helped to make them, and so my honor is
not bound by them. But you, papa, must keep them,
because you have been a lawmaker.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette’s discourse was cut short by the entrance of
the waiter with the supper, which he proceeded to arrange
on the table.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All ready, maister,” he said, with a flourish.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette took her seat at the head of the table to
pour out the tea.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force and Le sat down at opposite sides.</p>

<p class='c008'>Jonah stayed until Mr. Force told him he need not
wait. Then he went out, and was met at the door by
his sister Hester, who inquired:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wot was in t’ parcels t’ leddy carried to grandfeyther?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Bacco, sent by Uncle John.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! nawthing but ’bacco!” said the girl, in a tone
of disappointment.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>“There ain’t nothing better in this world nor ’bacco,”
replied the boy, as their voices passed out of hearing.</p>

<p class='c008'>The travelers finished their supper and soon after
retired for the night.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XL<br /> <span class='large'>LE’S DESPAIR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was a bright June morning when our small party
of travelers, having breakfasted well at the Anglesea
Arms, and settled with the landlady, once more entered
the dilapidated one-horse carriage, to be driven to the
railway station.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the front of the carriage was open, and every word
spoken by the travelers could be heard by the driver,
there was but little conversation indulged in except what
related to the weather or the scenery.</p>

<p class='c008'>The drive over the moors, although, in the springless
vehicle on the rough up-and-down hill, it shook the passengers
severely, was, in other respects, very pleasant.</p>

<p class='c008'>They reached the little way station in good time, and
had only a few moments to wait before the train came
up.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force was fortunate in securing a compartment
for himself and his companions; and it was not until
they were all three seated within it and the train was
in motion again that any opportunity for private conversation
was given.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, we have spent three days—I had nearly said
we have lost three days on our quest—and what have we
gained?” gloomily inquired Mr. Force. “Nothing apparently
but the knowledge that the deepest-dyed villain
in the whole world enjoys in his own neighborhood the
reputation of a saint, a sage, a hero and a philanthropist
rolled into one! It is very curious that a man may be
such an accomplished hypocrite all his life as to deceive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>all his neighbors, and then to go off into a foreign country
and give reins to his evil nature and reveal himself
as a pure devil! Clearly he must have been in California
when his wife was taken ill. Clearly he married
the Widow Wright during his wife’s lifetime, robbed
the dupe and fled back to England in time to play the
hypocrite at Lady Mary’s deathbed, and act chief
mourner at her funeral; then, under pretense that he
could not bear the house where he missed her every
hour, hastened back to America, but, giving his dupe a
wide berth, went to the North instead of the South, and
honored with his presence Niagara Falls, where we——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Foregathered wi’ the de’il,’” put in Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“True, my dear! We did! And we all suffered in
consequence.” Then turning to the young midshipman,
who sat buried in his bitter thoughts, he said: “Le, my
dear boy, do not be so utterly cast down. There must
be some way out of this trouble, and we will try to find
it. Let us do our best and trust in Providence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The young man shrugged his shoulders impatiently at
this well-meant piece of commonplace philosophy, as he
replied:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, uncle, there is a way out of it, if you would
only take it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What way, Le?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The divorce court.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Le! The very word, divorce, is an offense to decent
ears.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle! the most straitlaced of all the Christian
sects permit divorce under certain circumstances. The
Westminster Catechism, that strictest of all moral and
religious codes, provides for it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If all the world’s church and state were to meet in
convention and provide for it I would have none of it—except—except—as
the very last resort; and then, Le,
I should feel it as the very greatest humiliation of my
life.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>“Oh, uncle!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Listen, Le: Now that we know that Anglesea’s wife
was living at the time of his marriage with the Widow
Wright, we also know that marriage was unlawful; and
now that we furthermore know that his wife was dead
at the time of his marriage with Odalite Force we also
know that this last marriage was lawful.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle! uncle! I cannot bear——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“One moment, Le. Do not be so impetuous. I said
lawful—however wicked and immoral. And because it
was lawful, Le, my dear daughter is bound by it, to a
certain extent, and cannot form any matrimonial engagement
while this bond exists.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, good Heaven, sir——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Patience, Le. Hear me out. But, because that marriage
was wicked and immoral, it shall never go a step
further—it shall never be completed. That villain shall
never see or speak to my daughter again. I swear it
before high heaven! I shall keep Odalite at home under
my own immediate protection. If the scoundrel is not
hanged or sent to the devil in some other way before
many years, I suppose I shall be compelled to advise my
daughter to seek relief from the law. She could get it
without the slightest difficulty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But why not now?” pleaded the young man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because of the humiliation. It will seem a less matter
years hence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And in the meantime,” said Le, bitterly, “I am to
cherish murder in my heart day and night by wishing
that man dead!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush, Le, hush! Such thought is sin and leads to
crime.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Le said no more, but fell into a gloomy silence that
lasted until the train ran into Lancaster station.</p>

<p class='c008'>They went to dine at the Royal Oak, and from that
point Mr. Force telegraphed to Enderby Castle for a
carriage to meet the party in the evening at Nethermost.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Then they took the afternoon train and started on
their homeward journey.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sun was setting when they ran into the little wayside
station.</p>

<p class='c008'>A handsome open carriage, driven by the earl’s old
coachman, awaited them.</p>

<p class='c008'>They entered it at once, and the coachman turned the
horses’ heads and began to ascend the graded and winding
road that led up to the top of the cliff, and then
drove all along the edge of the precipice in the direction
of the castle.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a magnificent prospect, with the moors rolling
off in hill and vale, but always rising toward the range
of mountains on the east; and the ocean rolling away
toward the western horizon, where the sky was still
aflame with the afterglow of the sunset; while straight
before them, though many miles distant up the coast,
stretched out into the sea the mighty promontory of
Enderby Cliff, with the ruined border castle standing on
its crest, and the ocean beating at its base, while a few
yards nearer inland stood the latter building, which
was the dwelling of the earl and his household.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette had never been accused of artistic, poetic
or romantic tendencies, yet, gazing on that scene, she
fell into thought, thence into dream, finally into vision;
and she saw passing before her, in a long procession, tall
and brawny, yellow-haired savages, clad in the skins of
wild beasts, and armed with heavy clubs, which they
carried over their shoulders; then barbarians in leathern
jerkins, armed with bows and arrows; rude soldiers
with battle-axes and shields of tough hide; then a splendid
procession of mounted knights in helmets, shining
armor and gorgeous accouterments; ladies in long gowns
of richest stuffs and high headgear, that looked like long
veils hoisted above the head on a clothes prop; then
trains of courtiers in plumed hats, full ruffs, rich
doublets and trunk hose; and ladies in close velvet caps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>and cupid’s bow borders, large ruffs, long waists and
enormous fardingales; next a train of cavaliers, with
flapping bonnets, flowing locks, velvet coats and—</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wynnette!”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the voice of her father that broke the spell and
dispersed the visionary train.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you asleep, my dear?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“N-n-no, papa; only dreaming dreams and seeing
visions,” replied the girl, rousing herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, my dear, we are entering the castle courtyard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette looked out and saw that they were crossing
the drawbridge that had been down for centuries over a
moat that had been dry for nearly as long a period, and
which was now thickly grown up in brushwood, and
were entering under the arch of the great portcullis,
which had been up for as many years as the drawbridge
had been down and the moat had been dry.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were in the middle of the hollow square that
formed the courtyard of the castle. They had entered
on the north side. On the same side were the stables,
the kennels and the quarters for the outdoor servants.
Opposite to them, on the south side, were the conservatories
and forcing beds, protected by high walls. On the
east side was the modern Enderby Castle, where the earl
and his household lived in modest comfort. But on the
west side, overhanging the terrible cliff, was the ancient
Castle of Enderby, not quite a ruin, but deserted and
desolate, abandoned to wind and wave, given over to
bats and owls. At the foot of the awful rock the thunder
of the sea was heard day and night. Those who
lived habitually at the castle grew accustomed to it, but
to temporary sojourners at Enderby there was something
weird and terrible in the unceasing thunder of the
sea against the rock. There was said to be a whirlpool
through an enormous cavern at the foot of the cliff, having
many inlets and outlets, and that the sea was drawn
in and thrown out as by the sunken head of a many-mouthed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>monster. However that might be, it is certain
that even in the finest weather, when the sea was calm
everywhere else, the tempest raged against Enderby
Cliff.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The very, very first thing that I do to-morrow shall
be to explore that old castle from top to bottom,” said
Wynnette to herself, as the turning of the carriage hid
it from her view.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XLI<br /> <span class='large'>THE EARL’S PERPLEXITY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A footman was lighting the lamps in the hall when
the party entered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are all well in the house, Prout?” inquired Mr.
Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All well, sir. My lord is taking his afternoon nap.
The ladies are not down yet. The first dinner bell has
just rung,” replied the man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mamma and the girls are dressing for dinner, papa.
I will just run up and see,” said Wynnette, flying up
the stairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then we had better go to our rooms at once, Le, and
get some of the dust of travel off us before we go to
dinner,” said Mr. Force, as he followed Wynnette upstairs,
though in a more leisurely fashion. Perhaps he
was willing to put off, even for a few minutes, the painful
task of communicating his discouraging news to
Odalite.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Mr. Force reached his apartment he found
Wynnette standing in the middle of the room, under
the hands of her mother’s ebony maid, Gipsy, who was
helping her off with her duster.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where is your mother, my dear?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, they are all gone down to the drawing room.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>Prout was mistaken in thinking that they were not
there. But, papa, I am not sorry! Bad news will keep;
because being already spoiled, it cannot spoil any more.
And now we must hurry and dress, or the porridge will
be cold—I mean dinner will be kept waiting,” and saying
this, Wynnette caught up her hat and duster, and,
followed by Gipsy, passed into her own room, which she
occupied jointly with Odalite.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force used such dispatch in dressing that he was
the first one of the three returning travelers who entered
the drawing room.</p>

<p class='c008'>He found no one present but Mrs. Force, Odalite,
Elva and Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Force hurried to meet him, while Odalite stood
pale and waiting, and the two younger girls looked
eagerly expectant.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What news? What news?” anxiously inquired the
lady. “Prout has just told us of your return! What
news? Oh, why don’t you answer, Abel?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear, because I have no good news to tell you,”
he gravely replied.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Force let go the hand she had seized and sank
down upon the nearest sofa.</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite turned away and bowed her head upon her
hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rosemary and Elva were both too much awed by the
grief of their elders even to come forward and greet the
returned father and friend.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nor did Mr. Force even observe the omission. His
mind was absorbed by thoughts of his daughter’s distress.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Force was the first one to break the painful
silence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then it was all true as to the date of Anglesea’s first
wife’s death?” she inquired, in a faint voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The date on Lady Mary’s tombstone is August 25,
18—,” gloomily replied Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>“Then the man’s marriage with Mrs. Wright on the
first of the same August is invalid?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“As a matter of course.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And the ceremony begun, but not completed, with
our daughter in the following December gives Anglesea
a shadow of a claim on Odalite?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A shadow of a claim only; yet a sufficiently dark and
heavy and oppressive shadow. And now, dear Elfrida,
let us talk of something else,” said Mr. Force, gravely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“First, tell me about that fraudulent obituary notice
in the Angleton <cite>Advertiser</cite>. Did you find out how it
was effected?” inquired the lady.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. On the evening of the twentieth of August,
after the last copy of the paper had been printed, and
the whole edition sent off to its various subscribers, the
editor and proprietor, one Purdy, went home, leaving
the type undistributed on the press, and his pressman,
one Norton, in charge of the office. There was, besides,
the editor’s young son, whom Norton sent away. Later
in the evening this Norton distributed the type on the
first two columns of the first page, and then was joined
by Angus Anglesea, who had furnished the manuscript
for the false obituary notice, and had bribed the printer
to set it up and print it off. So then several copies of
the paper were thrown off, in all respects like unto the
regular edition of the day, with the exception of the
first two columns, in which the false obituary notice and
memoir were substituted for the report of an agricultural
fair, or something of the sort. And these last
fraudulent copies were mailed at different times to me.
You see the motive! It was to entrap and humiliate
us. The same night, or the next morning, Norton absconded
with the bribe he had taken from Anglesea.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know this to be true?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“As well as I can know anything that I have not been
an eye and ear witness to. I will tell you how I unraveled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>the mystery when we have more time. I wish to
speak to Odalite now, my dear,” said Abel Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>And he crossed to where his daughter stood, put his
arm around her waist, drew her to his heart, and said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cheer up, my darling girl. You shall be as safe
from all future persecution by that scoundrel as if he
were in the convict settlement of Norfolk Island—where
he ought to be. Try to forget all about him, my
dear, and remember only how much we all love you, and
how much we are anxious to do for your happiness.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite put her arms around her father’s neck, and
kissed him in silence, and smiled through her tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rosemary and Elva now came up, and put out their
hands to welcome the travelers home.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le came in, and almost in silence shook hands with
his aunt and the two younger girls, and then took the
hand of Odalite, pressed it, dropped it, and turned away
to conceal his emotion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lastly entered the earl, leaning on the arm of his
secretary.</p>

<p class='c008'>He smilingly greeted the returning travelers, and
hoped that they had had a pleasant journey.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fortunately the announcement of dinner prevented
the necessity of a reply. The earl gave his arm to his
sister, smiling warmly, as he said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it is you who must support me, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And they led the way to the dining room.</p>

<p class='c008'>Almost immediately after dinner, when the party returned
to the drawing room, Lord Enderby excused himself,
and retired to his own apartments, attended by his
secretary and his valet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. and Mrs. Force, and the young people, remained
in the drawing room, where Mr. Force gave a more
detailed account of his journey into Lancashire, his researches
at Anglewood, and all the circumstances that
led to the detection of the perpetrators of the obituary
fraud.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>“That is the way—or, rather, one way—in which
false evidence can be manufactured,” he said, in conclusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was late before the excited family party retired to
rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not until after breakfast the next morning,
when the young people had gone to take a walk on the
edge of the cliff, and the three elders were seated together
in the library of the castle, that Mr. Force told
Lord Enderby the story of his journey into Lancashire,
and its results.</p>

<p class='c008'>The poor earl looked the image of distress and perplexity;
his face, that was always pale, grew paler; his
frame, that was always infirm, grew shaky; and his voice,
always weak, became tremulous, as he said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am amazed beyond all measure. I am grieved to
the very soul. And—I am all but incredulous. Angus
Anglesea, my comrade in India! My ‘brother-in-arms,’
as I used fondly to call him. Angus Anglesea, the very
soul of truth and honor. Not overwise or prudent, but
brave and good to his heart’s core. I have not seen him
for years, it is true; but I had lost no faith in or affection
for him. Circumstances have separated us; but
neither coldness nor distrust had estranged us. And
now you tell me, Force, that this man has radically,
fundamentally changed his very nature—his very self—that
the man of pure truth, honor and heroism has
turned into an utter villain—a thief, a forger, a bigamist,
an unequaled scoundrel!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The earl paused and groaned as in pain.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am sorry to grieve you, my lord, but I have
brought unquestionable proofs of the charges that I have
made,” said Mr. Force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I admit the proofs; but, great heavens, that a man
could so change in so few years! My comrade in India!
My friend, whom I loved as a brother! Who could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>have thought it of him? Elfrida, you knew him in your
youth. Could you have believed this of him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not when I first met him in your company, my
brother; but then I was a very young girl, scarcely fifteen
years of age, and the judgment of such a girl on
the merits of a young man, especially when he is a young
officer in a brilliant uniform, and with a more brilliant
military record, is not infallible, you know,” replied
Mrs. Force, evasively.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yet you could not have believed this infamy of him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, certainly not,” replied the lady, more to soothe
the nervous invalid than to express her own convictions.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Believe me, I am deeply grieved to have been the instrument
of giving you so much pain. I would not
have told you had I not deemed it my duty to do so;
nor even under that impression had I supposed it would
have distressed you so much.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear Force, you were right to tell me, though
the hearing gives me sorrow—sorrow and perplexity, for
I cannot reconcile the story you have told and proved
with all my previous knowledge of Anglesea. I wonder,
has he become insane? I did hear that he had been
terribly affected by the death of his wife, whom he
adored. I was in Switzerland at the time, and when I
returned to England, in the autumn, I heard that he
had gone abroad. I think, perhaps, he may have become
insane.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Perhaps so,” said Mr. Force, but he mentally added:
“As much insane as, and no more, than every criminal
is insane—morally insane, but not, therefore, irresponsible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Force,” said the earl, “whatever may have been the
cause of Anglesea’s fall, your daughter Odalite must
be released from her bonds.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XLII<br /> <span class='large'>ENDERBY CASTLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>While their elders consulted together in the library
the four young girls, Odalite, Wynnette, Elva and Rosemary,
accompanied by Le and escorted by Joshua,
walked across the courtyard, and entered the old castle
to explore its interior.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le had in his hands a little guidebook to the castle
and town of Enderby, to which he referred from time to
time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Climbing over piles of rubbish, of fallen stones, covered
with moss and lichen, and half buried in rank
growth of thistles and briers, they entered an arched
doorway, and found themselves upon the stone floor of
the great feudal castle hall, which had once re-echoed
to the orgies of the feudal baron and his rude retainers
after a hunt, a foray, or a battle, but now silent and
abandoned to the birds of night and prey.</p>

<p class='c008'>At one end of this hall was a great chimney—a chimney
so vast that within its walls, from foundation stone
to roof, a modern New York apartment house of seven
floors might have been built, with full suits of family
rooms on every floor.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And this is only the hall fireplace,” said Le. “The
kitchen fireplace is immediately below this, and still
broader and deeper than this, but we cannot get to it
because it is buried in fallen stones and mortar. At
least, I mean, all entrance to that part of the castle is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They now noticed that the cavity of the deep chimney
place was furnished on each side with stone benches,
built in with the masonry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here,” said Le, “the wandering minstrel or the holy
pilgrim, of the olden time found warm seats in winter
to thaw out their frozen limbs.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Next they noticed that the hearth of the fireplace,
raised about a foot above the level of the floor, extended
about a quarter of the length of the hall itself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This,” said Le, “must be the dais for the upper portion
of the table, at which sat my lord baron, his family,
his knights, and his guests, while on each side of the
lower part sat the retainers. But say! Here is a trapdoor.
Immediately under here must have stood my lord
baron’s chair. Let us look at that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Le referred to the guidebook, and read:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Immediately before the hall fireplace and on the
elevated dais is a trapdoor connected with a walled-in
shaft, descending through the castle kitchen under the
hall, and into the ‘Dungeon of the Dark Death,’ under
the foundations of the castle. In the rude days of the
feudal system prisoners taken in war, or criminals convicted
of high crime, were let down through that trapdoor
into the Dungeon of the Dark Death, and never
heard of more. And the lord of the castle held high
festival above while his crushed victims perished below.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ur-r-r-r-r-r-r!” cried Wynnette, with a shudder.
“That accounts for my murderous instincts against Anglesea
and other culprits. I inherit it through my
mother—from all these vindictive old vampires.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Le! let us go away. I don’t like it. I don’t
like it!” pleaded little Elva.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No more do I,” said Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stay,” said Le. “Here is something more about the
place.” And he read:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘This trapdoor has not been opened for more than
fifty years. Tradition says that early in the last century
a groom in the service of the lords of Enderby
secretly married my lady’s maid, and as secretly murdered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>her and threw her body, together with that of her
infant, down the shaft, for which crimes he was tried,
condemned, and executed, and afterward hung in chains
outside the wall of Carlisle Castle. The trapdoor was
ordered to be riveted down by the then ruling Lord of
Enderby, and has never since been raised.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ur-r-r-r-r-r-r!” again muttered Wynnette. “That’s
worse than the other.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let us go away. Oh, I want to go away!” wailed
Elva, trembling.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, please, please come away, Le,” pleaded Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now just wait one moment, dears. You will not
mind looking out of these windows, loopholes, or whatever
they are, that open through the twelve-foot thickness
of the outer wall. Great pyramids of Egypt, what
mighty builders were these men of old!” exclaimed
Wynnette, walking off toward the east side of the hall,
where there were a row of windows six feet high and
four feet wide on the inner side, but diminishing into
mere slits on the outer side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here the baron’s retainers could safely draw their
bows and speed their arrows through these loopholes at
the besiegers without,” said Wynnette, curiously examining
the embrasures. “But, ah me, in times of
peace what a dark hall for the dame and her maidens.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, let us go on now,” said Le. “There is no
means of entering the lower portions of the building
from the outside, but I suppose there must be from the
inside.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So they left the hall by the side door and entered a
corridor of solid masonry, so dark that Le had to take
a match and a coil of taper from his pocket and strike
a light.</p>

<p class='c008'>This led them at last into a large circular room, with
lofty but narrow windows, through which the morning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>sun streamed, leaving oblong patches of sunshine on the
stone floor. A door on the side of the room, between
two of the windows, had fallen from its strong hinges,
and the opening was dark.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le approached it, and discovered the top of a narrow
flight of stairs built in the thickness of the wall.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le referred to his guidebook, and read:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Strong chamber in the round tower west of the
great hall, ancient guardroom for men-at-arms. A secret
staircase in the wall whose door was in former times
concealed by the leathern hangings of the room, leads
down to the torture chamber below.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who will go down with me?” inquired Le.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will,” promptly answered Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I,” added Odalite.</p>

<p class='c008'>Elva and Rosemary would have shrunk from the adventure,
but partly driven by the fear of being left alone,
and partly drawn by curiosity, they consented to descend
into the depths.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le preceded the party with his lighted taper, and they
followed him down the steep and narrow stairs, and
found themselves last in a dark, circular room, with
strong, iron-bound doors around its walls. Some of
these had fallen from their hinges, showing openings
into still darker recesses.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le, with his taper, crept along the wall exploring
these, and found them to be dark cells, scarcely with
space enough to hold a well-grown human being. Many
of them had rusting staples in the walls, with fragments
of broken iron chains attached.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even the young midshipman shuddered and refrained
from calling the attention of his companions to the
horror.</p>

<p class='c008'>But he made more discoveries than these. Groping
about the gloomy place with his wax taper, he came upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>various rusted and broken instruments of torture, the
thumbscrew, the iron boot, the rack, all of which he
recognized from the descriptions he had read of these
articles elsewhere; and there were other instruments
that he had read of, yet knew at sight to be of the same
sort; so that at last, when he came upon the grim headsman’s
block, it was with a feeling of relief.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What are those things, Le?” inquired Odalite, following
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, rubbish, dear. Be careful where you step, you
might fall over them,” he replied. “And I think we
had better leave this place and go to the upper air now,”
he added, groping along the walls to find the door at
the foot of the stairs down which they had come.</p>

<p class='c008'>He found the place, but found also something that
had escaped his notice. It was a niche in the wall beside
the door. The niche was about six feet high and
two feet broad; the opening was rough and ragged at
the sides, and there was a pile of rubbish at the foot,
which on examination proved to be fallen stones and
mortar.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le trimmed his taper until it gave a brighter light,
and then referred to his guidebook and unadvisedly
read aloud from it:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘In the Torture Chamber. Cunigunda. At the foot
of the stairs leading down to this dreadful theater of
mediæval punishment stands, in the right side of the
wall, a curious niche, high and narrow, which was once
the living grave of a lovely woman. About fifty years
ago the closing front wall of this sepulcher fell and revealed
a secret of centuries. A tradition of the castle
tells of the sudden disappearance of the Lady Cunigunda
of Enderby, the eldest daughter of the baron and
the most beautiful woman of her time, for whose hand
princes and nobles had sued in vain, because her affections
had become fixed on a yeoman of my lord’s guard.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>In the spring of her youth and beauty she was mysteriously
lost to the world. Her fate would never have
been discovered had not the closing wall of the niche at
the foot of the stairs in the torture chamber fallen and
disclosed the upright skeleton and the stone tablet, upon
which was cut, in old English letters, the following inscription:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c012'>
    <div>CUNIGUNDA,</div>
    <div class='c002'>Who, for dishonoring her noble family</div>
    <div>By a secret marriage with a common yeoman,</div>
    <div>Was immured alive in the 20th year of her age,</div>
    <div>January 24th, 1236.</div>
    <div class='c002'><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Requiescat in Pace.</span></i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The poor bones, after six centuries, were coffined and
consigned, with Christian rites, to the family vault at
Enderby Church.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I say, Le, what a perfectly devilish lot those old
nobles were! I proud of my ancestry! I would much
rather know myself to be descended in a direct line from
Darwin’s monkeys,” said Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, my dear, these men lived in a rude and barbarous
age. Their descendants in every generation have
become more civilized and enlightened, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I don’t know. And I like the monkeys a great
deal better as forefathers!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shall we try to find our way to the ‘Dungeon of the
Dark Death’? You know, it is under the kitchen which
is under the great hall. But stop a minute,” said Le:
and he referred again to the guidebook, and then added:
“No, we cannot go there. There is no reaching it. The
only entrance into that deep perdition is by the trapdoor,
on my lord baron’s dais, and down the hollow,
brick-walled shaft that runs through the middle of the
kitchen into the abyss below.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>“I am glad of it. Let us go to the upper light. Look
at Elva!” said Odalite, in an anxious tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le turned the light of the taper on the little girl,
and saw her leaning, pale and faint and dumb, on the
bosom of her sister.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My poor, little frightened dove. Why, Elva, darling,
what is the matter?” tenderly inquired the midshipman.</p>

<p class='c008'>The kind sympathy broke down the last remnant of
the child’s self-possession, and she broke into a gush of
sobs and tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le handed his taper to Wynnette and took Elva up in
his arms, laid her head over his shoulder, and carried
her upstairs, followed by Odalite, Wynnette and Rosemary.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the sun and air Elva recovered herself, and the
little party left the ruins to return to the new castle.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder my Uncle Enderby does not have that
dreadful old thing pulled down,” piped Elva, in a pleading
tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Pulled down!” exclaimed Wynnette. “Why, that
ancient castle is the pride of his life. The modern one
is nothing to be compared with it in value. The oldest
part of the ruin is said to be eight hundred years old,
while the modern castle is only a poor hundred and fifty.
Why, he would just as soon destroy his own pedigree
and have it wiped out of the royal and noble stud-book—I
mean, omitted from ‘Burke’s Peerage’—as pull
down that ancient fortress. Why, child, you do not
dream of its value. You have not seen a quarter part
of its historical attractions. If you hadn’t flunked—I
mean fainted, you poor, little soul—we should have gone
up the broad staircase leading from the hall to the staterooms
above—many of them in good preservation—and
seen the chamber where King Edward the First and
Queen Eleanor slept, when resting on their journey to
Scotland. Also the other chamber where William Wallace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>was confined under a strong guard when he was
brought a prisoner to England. Well, I don’t believe
a word of it myself. I suppose all these old battle-ax
heroes that ever crossed the border are reported to have
slept in every border castle, from Solway Firth to the
North Sea. Still, the old ruin is very interesting indeed.
And if the makers of the guidebooks like to tell these
stories, why, I like to look at the historical rooms.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette’s last words brought them to the new castle,
which they entered just in time for luncheon, in the
morning room.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XLIII<br /> <span class='large'>WYNNETTE’S STRANGE ADVENTURE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>What ailed Wynnette?</p>

<p class='c008'>That evening, while the family were all assembled in
the drawing room after dinner, she stole away and went
to find the housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c008'>The old woman was in her own sitting room, joining
the servants’ hall.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Kelsy welcomed the little lady, who had already
become a great favorite with her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I hope I don’t disturb you,” said Wynnette, deprecatingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dearie me, no, miss,” replied the housekeeper, rising
and placing a chair for her young visitor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette thanked her and sat down.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You have been over the old castle, I hear, Miss Wynnette,”
said the old woman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, and I came here to get you to tell me all you
know of that ancient ruin. You have been housekeeper
here for a long time, and you must know lots about it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, my dear young lady, I have been here, girl and
woman, for fifty years. My mother was housekeeper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>here before me. I was still-room-maid under until she
died about twenty years ago, and I got her place, through
the kindness of the earl.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That must have been very agreeable to you, as you
were so used to the house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was, my dear young lady, it was.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you must know lots of stories about the old
castle.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The housekeeper suddenly became silent and grave.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And your mother must have known lots more than
you did and told them to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The housekeeper looked solemn and reticent.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Didn’t she, now? You might as well tell me. I am
the niece of the earl, and my mother is his heiress-presumptive.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. I know that, young lady,” said Mrs. Kelsy,
speaking at last.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, then, you needn’t make a mystery of the matter
to one of the family, you know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it that you wish to hear, Miss Wynnette?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, any story of the old ruin, so that it is a really
marrow-freezing, blood-curdling, hair-raising story.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There is the guide to Enderby Castle, Miss Wynnette.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I know; but that contains only outlines—outlines
traced in blood and fire, to be sure, but still only
outlines. I want a story with more body in it. Come,
now, that story of the Lady Cunigunda of Enderby, who
was the greatest beauty of her time, for whom kings and
princes were vainly breaking their hearts, and who was
immured alive for marrying a handsome soldier. Come,
tell me all about her. That’s a darling.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear Miss Wynnette, I know no more about her
than you do. Not a bit more than what is printed in
the guide. No, nor yet did my old mother, rest her
soul.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, now, tell the truth. Does not the ghost of Lady
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>Cunigunda haunt the Round Tower in which she was
immured?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not as ever I heard of, my dear. Not as ever I
heard of.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, Mrs. Kelsy,” said Wynnette, solemnly, “I
thought the old castle was a venerable, historical building.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So it is, my dear. So it is. Nobody can gainsay
that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, Mrs. Kelsy, no castle, however ancient, and
however full of legends of kings and princes and heroes
and saints, can be even respectable, much less venerable,
unless it has its ghost.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Enderby Old Castle has its ghost, Miss Wynnette,”
retorted the old housekeeper, drawing herself up with
dignity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, I thought so! I knew so. Tell me about it,
Mrs. Kelsy!” eagerly exclaimed Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear, I cannot, especially to-night—especially
to-night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not to-night?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because, my dear, this very night of the twentieth
of June is the anniversary of the murder of that poor
young woman and her baby, when her spirit always revisits
the scene of her murder,” said the old woman,
solemnly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you mean—are you talking of the lady’s maid
who was murdered by the coachman, and whose body
was thrown down the shaft in the castle hall?” gravely
inquired Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush, my dear. Hush! Don’t talk of it, or you
may draw that perturbed spirit even here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know all about that tragedy, then?” persisted
Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My mother did, and told me. And people enough
have seen the ghost in the castle hall on this anniversary.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>“Have you ever seen it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hush! Yes, once; and I never want to see it again.
So that’s the last word I will speak about it to-night.
Some other time I’ll tell you all, but not now. Not
while her troubled spirit is abroad. Hush! What was
that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing but a sough of the wind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I thought it was the sob of a woman. I thought
it was her sob. Oh, my dear, for the Lord’s sake, drop
the subject,” pleaded the old woman.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will drop it this instant if you will promise to tell
me all you know some day soon,” whispered Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, yes, I promise. Let a Sunday and a church
service come between this night and the story, and I
will tell you on Monday,” said the housekeeper, whom
Wynnette’s persistence had brought to a state of great
nervous excitement.</p>

<p class='c008'>The young girl then arose and bade the old woman
good-night, and returned to the drawing room, where
she found all the family circle about to separate and
retire.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette went to the room which she shared with
her eldest sister.</p>

<p class='c008'>Odalite got ready and went to bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you done with the light?” inquired Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. Why?” inquired the elder sister.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because I want to turn it down low.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But are you not coming to bed?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not yet. I wish to open the shutters and look out
at the old castle by moonlight. I will draw the curtains
at the foot of your bed, so that the beams may not keep
you awake.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, the moonlight would never disturb my slumbers,
Wynnette,” said Odalite.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nevertheless, the younger girl went and drew the
white dimity curtains across the foot of the bed, which
was facing the west window. Then Wynnette turned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>down the light to a mere glow-worm size, and opened the
folding shutters of the window and sat down to look
out at the prospect.</p>

<p class='c008'>The moon was in its third quarter, had passed the
meridian, and was now halfway down the western hemisphere,
and hung over the sea, above the ruined castle on
the cliff, illumining the scene with a weird light.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette looked down on the great square inclosure
of the courtyard, shut in by strong walls of mighty
buildings on all four sides, the walls of the ancient ruin
being on the western side, directly opposite her window.
The courtyard was as secure and as clean as the carefully
kept interior of a barracks. And it was so quiet
at this hour that the sound of the sea, beating against the
rocks at the base of the old ruin, was heard as deafening
thunder.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Wynnette’s eyes were fixed on that row of ancient
windows in the ruined hall and looked like mere slits in
the wall.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now happened to the girl a very marvelous event.
As she gazed on these narrow openings they became
illumined from within by a strange light.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not from the moon, for the moon was far above,
and would have to be an hour lower to shed that light.
Besides, it was a dark, red light, like nothing on this
earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette gazed and wondered—wondered and gazed.
It was a steady light; it never wavered or flickered,
never brightened or faded.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette gazed and wondered—wondered and gazed,
until, drawn by an irresistible fascination, she arose
slowly and turned from the window, went past her sister’s
bed, stooped over, saw that Odalite was fast asleep,
and then she softly opened the chamber door, passed
out and closed it behind her.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the upper hall lights were always left burning
low through the night.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>By these Wynnette found her way down the grand
staircase to the armorial hall below.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here, also, lights were burning low.</p>

<p class='c008'>By these she found her way to the great west door
in front, took down the bars, unhooked the chain, drew
back the bolts, and turned the heavy key in the huge
lock—all so noiselessly as to make her wonder, until she
remembered how well-oiled every lock, key, bolt and
hinge was, to save the nerves of the invalid earl.</p>

<p class='c008'>She drew open the heavy doors and went out into
the night.</p>

<p class='c008'>The courtyard was bathed in moonlight, except where
the old ruin some yards in front cast its black shadow,
for the moon was now behind it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Everything was as still as death except the sea that
thundered at the foot of the cliff.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette felt no fear of material dangers. She knew
that she was as safe from harm as though she were in a
fortress.</p>

<p class='c008'>She went straight across the courtyard, drawing
nearer and nearer to the haunted castle; and as she approached
it she gazed more intently at those luridly
lighted loopholes. And then, oh strange! the lights
seemed not to come from torch or candle, but from
spectral eyes glaring forth into the night, and drawing
her on with an irresistible power. Wynnette could not
turn and fly; she was under a mighty spell, she must
move on—on—on—until she reached the pile of fallen
stones around the castle walls; and over these, climbing
with difficulty and danger, still moving on and on, until
she reached the portals.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great iron-bound oaken doors seemed now to be
closed and secured from within against intrusion, yet she
was still drawn on so powerfully that she pushed with
all her strength against those mighty doors, but with as
little effect as if she had tried to move a mountain.
When—</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>Suddenly the door opened, a cold hand seized her
wrist, drew her in, and the door closed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette’s blood curdled. She would have cried
out, but her organs of speech seemed paralyzed. She
would have struggled to free herself, but the icy hand
closed on her wrist like a fetter, and drew her on. She
could only pray mutely and hard.</p>

cold hand drew her on and on with irresistible power.</p>

<p class='c008'>Where was it taking her? Perhaps to the terrible
trap opening into the shaft leading down to the dread
Dungeon of the Dark Death, under the foundations of
the castle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Oh, if she could only cry out. Oh, if she could only
tear herself away from her horrible invisible captor.
Oh, if she could but see where she was. But her voice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>seemed palsied and her limbs paralyzed, while she was
drawn on and on through deepest darkness by an icy,
invisible, irresistible hand. On and on, now to the right,
now to the left, now up a few rugged steps, and now
down and down into deeper depths of darkness, if that
were possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>Once more Wynnette tried to cry out, but failed;
tried to escape, but failed; strained her eyes to see, but
failed utterly in all attempts.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is a dream! It is a nightmare! Oh, if I could
only scream so they would hear me and come to me.
Oh, father! Oh, mother! Oh, Lord, have mercy on
me!” her spirit cried, in her agony of terror, but no
word came from her frozen lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>Down—down—down—into profounder abysms of
blackness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Where were they going? Under the foundations of
the castle? Under the bed of the sea? To the very
center of the earth? Would they never stop descending?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, what a fool I was to come here at midnight.
Shall I ever get out of this alive? Oh, no—never. Oh,
what a horrible fate. Will they ever find me or my
body? Oh, no—never. How could they? Oh, my dear
mother! Oh, my dear father! What ever will you
think has become of me—your wilful Wynnette? My
whole arm is freezing from the clasp of that icy hand
around my wrist. What is it going to do with me? But
it is only a dream. I know it is only a dream. A cruel,
deadly nightmare. Oh, if I could only scream. If I
could only struggle and wake up. But I shall die in
my sleep here, and they will find me dead in the morning.
Oh, Lord, forgive my sins and save my soul.
What was that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly the silence of that utter darkness was
broken by a sound that became a noise, a roar, a deafening
thunder, and Wynnette, in the anguish of her utter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>terror and helplessness, heard and knew the thunder of
the sea against the rocks. But the air was growing close,
fetid, sulphurous, suffocating.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is no nightmare. I hear the sea. It is breaking
in mighty waves over my head. Ah, my limbs are numb—my
breath is gone—my brain is going. Oh, if I could
only cry out once. Mother! Mother!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the darkness and the coldness as of death closed
in, wrapped around, and settled down upon her with
the weight of the grave.</p>

<p class='c008'>And for the time being Wynnette was dead and
buried to all life, sense and consciousness.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Wynnette breathed again and opened her eyes
she could not at once recover her consciousness. The
shock and strain upon her nervous system had been too
severe and protracted. She heard and saw as one half
asleep. She heard the awful reverberations of the thunder
of the sea. She saw around her blackness of darkness,
relieved just in one spot, a few yards distant from
where she lay, by a small fire on the ground, that smoldered
in the foul air, and cast a lurid light but a few
feet around, and fell upon the face and form of a
crouching figure squatted near it.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a Rembrandt picture.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette watched it in weak, dull, stupid despair.
Whether it was man, woman, or even human being, she
neither knew, nor cared, nor questioned. Nor could any
one else, even in the full possession of their senses, have,
at sight, classified the strange figure squatted by the low
fire in the subterranean abyss.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette was too stunned, dazed and weakened even
to fear it.</p>

<p class='c008'>And yet it was a dread, a frightful, a terrible form,
tall and gaunt as could be well known, even in that
crouching attitude, by the length of legs and arms. Its
skin was like wrinkled parchment, and clung close to its
bones. Its face and features were strong and bony and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>sharp. The eagle nose and the pointed chin nearly met
over the sunken mouth. Burning black eyes flashed and
flamed under beetling brows. White hair, parted over
the top of the head, rolled in silver waves down over
shoulders and back. It wore but one garment, a dark
red gown, with sleeves that only reached to the elbow,
and a skirt that only reached to the knees. It was
squatting, as we said before. Its knees were drawn up;
its long, gaunt, dark arms were around them, and the
great claw-like fingers were clasped upon them. The
head was bent, but the blazing eyes were fixed in a burning
gaze upon the face of the recumbent girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>As memory slowly awoke in the mind of the stupefied
girl, she began to recall some of the phases of her night’s
adventure. When had it happened? How long ago?
An hour ago? A day? A year? A century? How
long? And where was she now? She dimly remembered
when she died, and how she died—how the faintness
of death crept upon her; how her breath went and
then her sense, and then—nothingness.</p>

<p class='c008'>But how long was that ago?</p>

<p class='c008'>She could not think.</p>

<p class='c008'>Where was she now?</p>

<p class='c008'>She could not say.</p>

<p class='c008'>Only one thing was certain. She had died, and she
had come to a bad place for her sins. She was in
darkness. She was in—that awful pit of utter despair
whose name she could not bear to breathe to her own
spirit.</p>

<p class='c008'>And that thing by the smoldering fire was her demon
jailer!</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus much was certainly true, she thought. And
yet so dull and stupid was she still that she did not care
very much where she was, or even wonder at her own
insensibility.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last, seeing that the creature by the fire still glared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>at her, she tried to speak, and at length muttered the
question:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who are you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nobody,” was the slow, soft answer, in a tone
strangely sad and sweet to come from such dried and
withered lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you—alive?” breathed Wynnette, in fearsome
tones.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Alive? Nay, babe, nor are you,” replied the same
slow, sweet voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought so; that is, I knew I was dead. But I
thought maybe you and—and—and—the other dev—I
mean the other—I mean I thought the natives of this
place might be alive,” faltered Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nay, child, I am dead as well as thou. We are both
dead. But I have been dead longer than thou! Ay, ay,
many years than thou, I reckon; for thou cannot be older
than sixteen or seventeen, and I be ninety-seven. Ay,
ay, I ha’ been dead a long time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The voice that spoke those words was as tender and
plaintive as the notes of an Eolian harp.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are—we—are—we—in h—I mean, are we in the
woeful place?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, babe, we are in the woeful place. You and I
and many, many, many millions, and millions and millions
of others are dead and buried, and in the woeful
place.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I feel as if I were alive, though. No, not quite; but
almost alive,” said Wynnette, first pinching her own
arm and then setting her teeth in it, and biting so hard
that she only escaped breaking the skin.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s a delusion, my baby. You are not alive,
neither am I. But—they are alive!” she cried, lifting
and waving her arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They? Who?” demanded Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They—the victims of hate, power, cruelty and despotism,
whose ruined earthly tabernacles lie all around
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>us. All around us, like the broken shells upon the seashore.
They are alive! They are the martyrs of love
and truth; the martyrs of faith and freedom, of humanity.
They are alive, baby. They stand among that
‘great multitude, which no man could number, of all
nations and peoples and kindreds and tongues—before
the throne—clothed with white robes and palms in their
hands.’ Ay, ay! They are alive! But you and I—we
are dead.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—I think I understand,” said Wynnette, who was
beginning to regain her mental faculties and to recognize
in her surroundings some subterranean cave of the cliff,
or crypt of the castle, and in her companion some harmless
lunatic. “We are in a sense dead and buried, and
in a woeful state; but where, in all this woeful state, are
we now sitting?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t ye ken, bairnie, we are in the place the tyrants
called the Dungeon of the Dark Death? And the heaps
of gray and white lime that ye see here—or ye might
see, gin it were light enough—be the moldering bones of
their victims. And the latest victim of all was my lass!
my lass! But death could not hold her, nor darkness,
nor coldness. She came to life and ascended.
She is a fair angel now—one of the fairest of angels.
But though she is alive and we are dead, she has not
forgotten us; but she comes on this day every year and
visits our graves. I always see her when she comes. I
can see her through all the clods of the grave that lie so
heavy on my heart. Mayhap you may see her, too, baby;
but I don’t know, I don’t know,” murmured the plaintive
voice, as the old creature slowly shook her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Does she—does she come here?” breathed Wynnette,
in an awe-struck tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ay, she does; and every time she comes she shows
me how her body was murdered, and how herself came
out of it alive. Look! look!” The woman suddenly
started up, crossed to the side of the girl, and clasped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>her hand and held it fast, saying again: “Look! Listen!”
and she pointed up to the upper end of the cavern.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now by what psychological law this weird old creature
impressed her own visions on the imagination of
the girl, let the occult scientists explain. I cannot pretend
to do so.</p>

<p class='c008'>But as Wynnette looked and listened, there came a
whir-r-r-r through the air, and a thud-d-d upon the distant
ground, and the form of a young woman and a
child lay there.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette tried to shriek, but her voice died in her
throat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You see her?” murmured the old woman.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette tried to speak, but failed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Watch!” said the crone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette watched, breathlessly, her senses reeling.
The shape presently began to change as clouds change,
from form to form, and presently to arise like a pillar
of mist, and take the form of a woman, young, fair,
angelic, with an infant pressed to her bosom, and with
heavenward gaze, slowly ascending in a path of light,
which faded as she disappeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There, she has gone! and we will go,” said the crone,
as she tightened her grasp on the girl’s hand and drew
her away.</p>

<p class='c008'>No longer terrified, but awed, confused, bewildered,
Wynnette allowed herself to be passively drawn away,
and they began to toil up from the depths. Wynnette
thought of Dante’s return from the Inferno, when he
“saw the stars again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At length, more dead than alive, she began to realize,
that though they were still in darkness, they were creeping
over level ground or a stone floor. They were stealing
along a dark and narrow passage, as she thought;
for once when she stretched out her hand at arm’s length
she felt the damp stone wall.</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently, far off ahead of them, she saw the faint
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>glimmer of a red light. As they drew nearer to this,
she saw that it came through the chinks of an ill-fitting
door.</p>

<p class='c008'>When they reached the door the crone opened it, and
Wynnette recognized, with feelings of relief, the great
hall of the castle, and knew that they were above ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>A fire of faggots burned on the flagstones, and burned
more clearly in the freer air than had that smoldering,
smoking heap of rubbish in the subterranean dungeon
below.</p>

<p class='c008'>The beldame drew the girl toward the fire, where
there lay near by a pile of rushes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sit ye down here, lass, and rest,” she said, as she herself
dropped in a heap upon the rushes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—I want to go home,” whimpered Wynnette, in the
tone of a frightened child.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nay, bairn, thou wants to hear the story of my lass,
and none but I can tell it. Not yon woman up in the
new castle, for she but repeats the lies she has been told,
and she believes. None but I can tell the true story.
Sit ye down, bairn, and hear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But—it is so late—so late—I ought to go home,”
said Wynnette, divided between curiosity and uneasiness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is not late. It is not yet one hour past midnight;
and thou art a brave bairn, and there be none to harm
thee. Besides, I must tell thee the true story.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette drew some of the rushes into a heap, and
sat down upon them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XLV<br /> <span class='large'>TOLD IN THE OLD HALL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“It was fifty years ago, my bairnie—fifty years ago.
Earl Hardston ruled at Enderby. Distant cousin he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>was to yon present Earl Francis——What was that?
Eh! nothing but the flap of the owl’s wing as it passed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Earl Hardston ruled at Enderby. A handsome devil
he were. Tall, broad-shouldered, straight-backed,
strong-limbed. His hair was black and glossy as the
raven’s wing; his eyes were black and fiery as the hawk’s,
and sometimes soft as the dove’s. Ah, a taking rascal he
were.</p>

<p class='c008'>“His lady mother and his lady sisters lived at the
castle, and were to live there until my lord should marry,
when they would all go to Kedge Hall, the dower-house
of the Widows of Enderby. Kedge Hall was no to be
compared to Enderby Castle, and so my lady and her
daughters were no minded that my lord should take a
wife.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, but they were wicked!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Handsome jades they were, every one. Black-a-vized,
like me lord, but not one of them to hold a candle to my
lass, though she were the hen-wife’s child, and her
feyther the undergardener.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, but she were the beauty of the world!</p>

<p class='c008'>“I ha’e seen the Venus in the castle gallery, but it
was no to be compared to my lass’ form. And her features
were small and fine and clean-cut, and her skin
was like the wild rose leaf. Her eyes were blue as
violets, and her hair was yellow and soft and silky as the
fringe of the young maize corn.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, but she was the beauty of the world!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Everybody was in love with her. Every servant in
the castle, from the old bachelor-butler down to the boy
in buttons, which they called the page, was half mad for
the love of my lass. Every laborer in the grounds, from
the widowed gamekeeper down to the youngest stableboy,
was half dying for the love of my lass.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, bairnie, she did not scorn any of them—not the
lowliest. She had a smile and a gentle glance, and a
kind word for every one—even for the freckle-faced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>and red-haired young groom, who always had a cold in
his head and a swelled nose, and used to follow her about
like a dog, until he lost his place for neglecting his business.
She was kind and good to all.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, but she was the angel of the world, was my
lassie. She were sweet and tender to every one, but she
would ha’e none o’ them i’ the way o’ marriage. That
were too much to ask, she thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So time went on, till my lass was twenty years old,
and she had never lo’ed a man. And my lord were
thirty, and he had never married a wife.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ane autumn my lord had a company of friends staying
at the castle—gentlemen friends, the lot of them.
Sorrow a lady was ever asked to the castle barring it
was some old lady without daughters, or nieces, or any
women at all. It was not my lady countess who would
throw temptation to matrimony in the way of her son,
the earl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, but she was the devil of the world. You shall
hear, my bairn. You shall hear. Among the company
at the castle was ane painter lad, which even the king
made much of—so ’twas said—so fine was his paintings.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My lady countess had noticed my lass, my Phebe.
Ane day she sent a lackey down to my cottage, with
orders for me to bring my girl up to the castle. So I
obeyed my lady.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We were showed to a room full of pictures, and
images, and rubbish, which I soon found out was the
painter lad’s workshop. My lady was there, sitting in
the only easy-chair. And the painter lad was there,
standing before a queer prop, with a picture on it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As soon as the lackey said, ‘The young woman, my
lady,’ and shut the door, the countess looked at us without
speaking, and then turned to the painter, and said,
‘Here is your model, Mr. Fordyce,’ as if my Phebe had
been nothing but a bundle of lumber.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The painter lad was an ugly little mug as ever was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>seen, but a great painter he were, and a civil man. He
looked at my Phebe, and I could see the surprise and
delight in his ill-favored little face, and he bowed to
her, and handed both of us to seats. My lady frowned,
and he blushed, and said something very softly, which I
thought was asking pardon for his civility to us.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aweel, bairnie, that were the beginning o’ the end.
Fra that day my lass went up to the castle every day, in
obedience to my lady’s orders. I do not know, I cannot
tell when it was, or how it was, that my lord first began
to be present at the ‘sittings,’ as they called them.
Maybe he heard the painter lad praising the beauty of
my lass, for, bairnie, though she was born and brought
up on his land, he had never seen her, for he never
showed his face down in such low places as his laborers’
huts. So, maybe, he heard the painter lad praising her
beauty, and for curiosity went in to take a look at her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But sometimes I think my lady countess planned it
all—to amuse my lord, and keep him at home. What
did she care for a peasant girl’s heart, or her soul, or
her good name, either, if she could amuse my lord and
keep him from going off and getting married, and bringing
a wife home to send her and her lady daughter to
Kedge Hall?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, but she was the devil of the world!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah me! ah me! ah me! I did not know what was
going on. You see, I didn’t go with my lass to the
castle after that first time. My lady’s maid, an aul
wife, always came and fetched her. No, I did not know
what was going on. And why should I tell you of wickedness
that is not for you to hear?</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, no, I will pack the whole peck into a pint cup,
and make an end of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, such an old tale. Oh, such a common tale. It
is heard in every hamlet, on every hillside. Oh, but it
comes home to one when it’s one’s ain child. Ah me!
ah me!</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>“Late in the autumn the pictures were finished and
the sittings were over, and the painter lad went his way
back to London. And my lass stayed hame with me
and only went out sometimes in the gloaming. I never
thought ill. I used to go to look after the poultry
yard by the castle stables every day, and sometimes, with
the gathering and sorting of eggs, and other matters, I
would be kept at work all day long.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One day I got on wi’ my work so weel that I cam’
hame airlier than common. And there, i’ the hut, was
my lord, wi’ Phebe on his knee and his arm around her
waist. Before I could weel tak’ in the whole, my lord
had risen, and, with a ‘Good-e’en, dame,’ he passed me,
and went out. And I sat down on the floor and covered
my head wi’ my apun. I could speak no word of
blame to my lass; my heart, it was broken.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Presently she came to me and put her sweet arms
around my neck, and said to me, in her ain sweet voice,
‘Minnie, minnie, I canna see you grieve and not tell you
the truth, though I must break my word to do it. Minnie,
yon great earl is my husband and your son, and I
love him as I love my life!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bairnie, ye may think I were surprised at what I
heard, but, indeed, I were not. I were very pleased, and
that’s the truth, but not surprised. I thought my lass
the beauty of the whole world. And the angel of the
whole world, and our folk-lore were full of tales of how
noble lords, and even royal princes, did love and marry
peasant girls for their beauty and for their goodness.
And who so beautiful and who so good as my ain lass?</p>

<p class='c008'>“No. I was not surprised, but I was proud and
pleased. I only asked her the how and the when, and
the where, and when she had told me I believed in her,
as I had a right to believe in her, but I also believed in
him, as I had no right to believe in any man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And then she begged me to keep the secret, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>she had broken her promise to keep it from everybody,
and had told me, from love of me.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I swore that I would keep her secret, and I kissed
her, and petted her, and loved her. And she said, ‘Now
I am completely happy, dear minnie, as I never was
when I kept a secret from mine ain minnie.’ Ah me! ah
me! But, there. She is still happy. I only am miserable.
She is alive! I only am dead! But some time or
other I shall come to life and be happy with her. Where
was I, bairnie? What was I telling you last?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of your dear daughter’s secret marriage with the
earl, and of your promise to keep the secret,” said
Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ay, ay! And we were happy that night. Phebe
and I. And I hugged her to my heart as we slept together,
and I called her ‘My little countess! My little
countess!’ Ah, I was drunk with pride and vanity. Not
for myself, but for my beauty and angel of the world. I
could not sleep for thinking of her and of her grandeur.
Only I did think that mayhap if the king had chanced
to come by our way and see her the king himself might
ha’ married her and made her a queen. And I did not
care for the earl so much but that I was sorry it was not
the king who had seen her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Next morning Phebe went back to her spinning and
I went to the henhouse. I quieted down and began to
go over the tales in our folk-lore—and I thought, with
uneasiness, how King Cœphutas, who married the beggar
girl, and the other king that married the nut-brown
maid, and all other kings and princes and nobles who
had married good and beautiful peasant maids, had
wedded them in open day before all the world, with a
great flourish of trumpets and blowing of horns, and
flaunting of flags, in honor of the wedding, and all the
neighboring kings, and princes, and lords, and nobles
invited to the feast. And here was this earl, who was
neither king nor prince and nobody but an earl had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>married the beauty and the angel of the world, in the
dark behind the door, as it were, and keeping his marriage
a secret as if he was ashamed of it. I wondered
what he meant. I thought if it had been the king who
had married my lass he would not have done so.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When I came hame that night I asked my girl how
it was. And she told me it was from fear of his mother,
who had set her heart on his marrying the daughter of
a duke. The daughter of a duke, indeed. What was
the daughter of a duke compared to the beauty and the
angel of the whole world, as kings and princes would
ha’ fought for, if they had only seen her? But it was
all a lie, for my lady countess, she had set her heart on
his never marrying anybody so long as she should live.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought the earl was unworthy to be compared
with the kings and princes of our folk-lore. And I
feared my lass had thrown herself away on an ungrateful
earl—a mere common earl—when she might have
married a king or an emperor if she had only waited
until one passed by and saw her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But it was done, and he was her husband, so I would
not say anything to set her against him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, well, as the days and the weeks passed I got
mortal tired of waiting for him to own my girl his wife,
and take her to the great house with blowing of trumpets,
and waving of banners, and flaunting of flags, and
prancing of steeds, like I had heard of. What was the
use of my girl being the wife of a great lord, if she had
to wear a linsey gown, and sit in the hut and spin all
day long while I was away to the henhouse? Why,
none at all.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>“Oh, bairn, it is such a help to my poor heart telling
you all this. And you believe me, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe every word you say—tell me more,” earnestly
replied Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“At long last my lady countess and her young lady
daughters went up to London town. And now I thought,
while they are gone, my lord will take his wife hame to
the great house; but he didn’t, bairn; he didn’t. Oh, he
didn’t. He was abroad somewhere, to France, maybe,
or to Paris, or some other furrin country thereaway.
And my lass gave herself up to weeping, and never
showed herself abroad, but stayed in the hut. One day
I laid a baby boy in her arms and told her to be comforted,
for that her son was the little Lord Glennon and
the heir to the Earldom of Enderby.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And then I had to tell my neighbors the secret, for I
could not bear they should think ill o’ my ain lass. But
nane o’ them would believe me. Not one. They laughed
me to scorn—me and my lass. It is an old tale—oh,
such an old tale, such a common old tale! Only it
comes hame when it’s one’s ain bairn.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One day my lord came hame and heard the report,
and a fine passion he was in with my lass and me. He
denied her and her child. He pretended it was Andy,
the stableboy, she had married. And he scorned her,
and threatened to turn us both out of the hut if we ever
so much as named his name again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, but he was the devil of the whole world!</p>

<p class='c008'>“After that, in many long nights that my lass and
I lay awake, we talked, and I got to know why the great
earl had married my beauty and angel of the whole
world. First he tried to win her love without her hand;
but my girl was good and firm; and then he grew so mad
for her love that he took her before a priest and married
her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One day we did hear that the earl was to wed the
duke’s daughter, and all the cottagers said I was a mad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>crone to think my lord had stooped to my lass. Ah, my
lass! She was fading away before my very eyes. But
not fast enough for my lord.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One day there was a fair at Enderby Town, and all
the laborers on the estate and all the servants at the
castle had a holiday to go to the fair. All went but me
and my lass. We ne’er left hame in those days. We
could no bear that any should look on us and scorn us.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So that day I left my lass spinning at the hut door,
and the baby was sleeping in the basket by her side, and
I went to my duty in the hen-houses. I had the old
nests to clean out and fresh straw to put in them. I
got done about twelve of the clock and come hame.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But my girl was not in the house, nor the babe. I
had no misgiving. I went in and waited for her. But
she came no more. She never came again. When it
grew dark I began to be so uneasy that I went out to
look for her, but could no find her. There was no one
as I could ask; all the world was gone to the fair, and
nane would be hame till late, maybe not till morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, bairn, when I had walked till my limbs were
ready to sink under me I went hame and laid down, just
as I was, on the outside of my bed. I was not asleep.
Nay, bairnie, I was not asleep. I did no dream what
followed. I saw it. My eyes were shut and all the
world was still; for it was long after midnight, and even
drawing near the morning; but still it was pitch-dark,
when—no, I wasn’t asleep, and I didn’t dream it—when
I felt a light through my shut eyelids. I opened them
and saw the room was full of light that did not come
from sun, or moon, or star, or candle, or lamp, or fire,
but from a bright form that stood in the midst of the
place and beckoned me to come to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In an awe that was not a fright, I got up and went to
it and said ‘Phebe!’ for I knew it was my lass that stood
there, with her child in her arms, and clothed, not in
the white raiment of the blest, but in what I thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>was lovelier, a clear, soft, rosy gown that fell from her
shoulders down to her feet. She had no crown on her
head, but her silky, yellow hair streamed down around
her form like sunbeams. I knew she was a spirit.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Phebe!’ I said again—‘Phebe!’ She did not speak,
but holding her child on her right arm, she raised her
left hand and beckoned me, and pointed to the door, and
went out. I followed her. She led me by ways I had
never gone before, but have gone every year since that
night. The same way I took you to-night, my bairn.
The secret passage to the deep caverns under the foundations
of the castle, the only way to them except through
the trapdoor and shaft that runs two hundred feet
down in a straight line—a way that is now known to
none but me. Even you could no find it again. She led
me through the secret passage and down the many, many
steps cut in the solid rock, down, down, down, her light
making the steep path light before me until we reached
the Dungeon of the Dark Death—and even that she
lighted up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She led me to a spot where her dead body lay on
the ground, just under the bottom of the shaft, that
reached only to the ceiling or roof above. Her body lay
with the body of her babe, just as if they both had
dropped down there and fallen asleep. I knew they
were dead. I knew every bone in both was broken,
though that did not appear on the outside. It was
under where they struck the ground that the horror of
death was. I knew also, as if I had seen it all, how she
had died—how she had been entrapped to her sudden
death—how she had not even suffered. There had been
a swift fall, a shock, nothing, and then a wonderful coming
to life in a new form.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I tell you, lass, it was no dream, no dream! but a
real seeing. And it was wonderful to stand there by
the two crushed, dead bodies and see the two living
souls. I thought of the chrysalis and the butterfly, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>worm and the moth, the eggshell and the bird, as I stood
there between life and death, and seeing both.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And without any speech at all, my lass made me
know how she had been betrayed to death—how, every
one being gone off the place, and she alone in her hut,
my lord had come to her and pretended to make it all
up with her, and had asked her to walk with him in the
hall of the old castle. And she had gone. And they
walked up and down, up and down, until suddenly, when
she was passing with her babe over the trapdoor they
had passed so many times, he suddenly stepped back,
the door fell in, and she shot down, struck the ground
two hundred feet below, and knew no more until she
woke up in her new form—not dead, but living, never
more to die.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Presently she beckoned to me again, and walking
before me, a form of rosy light, led me back again by
the way we had come, up, up, up, to the upper air again.
Nor did she leave me until we were back in the hut.
She waved her arm and signed for me to lie down on
the bed; and I minded her and did what she said. Then
she stood by my bed waving her hand to and fro, to and
fro, until I went to sleep. And I slept so deep and so
long that it was broad daylight, with the sun shining in
at the bare window, when I waked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, it was no dream, bairn. Soon as I waked I
minded all that had passed in the night, and I knowed
it was no dream.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I went no more out that day. At noon my lord came
to the hut, the first time he had come for many a day.
And he asked me, in a careless way:</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Where is that wench of yours, goody?’ And I
looked him straight in the face, and answered him:</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Her body and her babe’s lie crushed to death on the
stone floor of the deep dungeon where you cast her down;
but she and her child—they are in Paradise.’</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>“He turned white as a sheet and he reeled in his saddle;
but he quickly put on a bold face and said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘You are a mad old beast, and before twenty-four
hours are over your head you shall be committed to the
County Lunatic Asylum.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“And with that he struck spurs into his horse and
dashed wildly away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not too often, lass, does punishment follow fast on
crime, but it did in this case. He dashed wildly off in
a state of mind, I reckon, that made him unable to guide
his young horse as he ought.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Half an hour later he was carried hame to the castle
on a shutter. The horse had thrown him and broken
his neck.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The title and estates, they went to a distant cousin,
great-grandfather of the present Earl Francis. Earl
Godfrey was good to me—he and his children and his
children’s children have been good to me—always good
to me, although they call me mad.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When my girl was missed and the trapdoor was
found open, they had it that she had trodden on it and
it had gin way under her weight, and her death was a
accident and nobody to blame. They wouldn’t listen to
me—no one word. They said I was a poor, harmless
creetur, crazed by the loss of my lass. They got a windlass
and great chains and ropes, and then let down men
and they took up my birds’ broken shells and gave them
Christian burial.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Everybody was kind to me, only they wouldn’t believe
me. They said I was mad. They would have it as
it was the poor stableboy as wronged my girl. And now
I hear, after more than fifty years, some un have made
another story and got it into a book, how the stableboy
killed my girl and threw her body down the shaft,
and was hanged for it at Carlisle. All lies, bairn! All
lies! My story is the only true one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe you,” said Wynnette.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>“The sky is red in the east. Go now, my bairn.
Thou art a good child, and brave to dare the ghosts of
the old hall and to hear the tale of an old crone. And
it is true, bairn; it is true. Do not you give faith to
any who tell you it is not and tell you I am mad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will not. I will believe only you. But before I
go tell me—can I do anything for you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nay, bairn. Nothing, bless ’ee.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where do you live?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the old hut—the hut outside the south wall, open
to the lane.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can find it. May I come to see you there?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ay, ay, bairn. Bless ’ee for the kind thought. Come
when thou like, but dinna bring ony other with ’ee. Na
other might hear me sa kind and mind me sa well as
ye do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you—are you—have you—will you——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette hesitated and blushed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Speak out, bairn. Dinna be feared. Speak out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then—will you have—a good breakfast ready for
you when you go home?” hesitatingly inquired practical
Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall have all I want, bairnie. Earl Francis has
provided for me. Go your ways to the house now,
bairnie. Your friends will be speiring after ye.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette took the shriveled hand of the creature and
pressed it kindly before she left the old castle hall.</p>

<p class='c008'>The early June morning was breaking brightly and
beautifully over land and sea as Wynnette went down
the half-ruined steps that led from the castle hall to the
courtyard below.</p>

<p class='c008'>She climbed over the piles of rubbish, and at length
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>found herself on the flagged walk that led up to the west
entrance of the new castle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not a soul was yet astir. It could not have been more
than half-past four o’clock, and the servants of the castle
were not accustomed to rise before six.</p>

<p class='c008'>She went up the broad stone stairs and opened the
door, which she found, as she had left it at midnight,
unfastened.</p>

<p class='c008'>She passed in silently, quietly replaced all the fastenings,
and ascended noiselessly to her room. Her sister
was still sleeping soundly. She felt no disposition to
sleep. She resumed her seat at the west window, and
looked out upon the morning view, as she had looked on
the night scene, trying to understand the adventure she
had passed through.</p>

<p class='c008'>Was the old crone who had talked with her really
mad? Had her only child been ruined and murdered
by the wicked earl? Had she, Wynnette, really witnessed
that wonderful vision in the dungeon under the
castle, or had she been so psychologized by the crone as
to have been the subject of an optical illusion?</p>

<p class='c008'>She could not tell! She could make nothing of her
night’s experience. While she was musing over it all
her thoughts grew confused, her vision obscured, and
perhaps she fell asleep; for she was presently roused as
from profound unconsciousness by the voice of Odalite
calling out to her:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wynnette! Wynnette! Child! you have never slept
at that open window all night? How imprudent!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl roused herself and tried to recall her faculties.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe I did fall asleep, Odalite,” she replied; but
she shuddered as she remembered her night’s adventure.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And you are shivering now. And you are pale and
heavy-eyed. Oh, my dear, what an indiscreet thing to
do—to sleep with your head on the sill of an open window!
You have caught cold.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>“Ah! if you only knew what I have caught,” thought
Wynnette; but she answered:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, no, I have not, Odalite. I am going to take a
bath now and dress for breakfast. I am all right. How
could I take cold on such a lovely night in June?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you must not repeat this,” said Odalite.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t mean to!” significantly replied Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>An hour later they met the family at breakfast.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette was so unusually grave and silent that at
length her uncle noticed her manner and inquired:</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is the matter with our Little Pickle this morning?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She sat in the chair at the open window all night,
and fell asleep there. That is the matter,” replied Odalite
for her sister.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah! ah! that will never do! We must put a stop to
that sort of practice!” replied the earl.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then Mr. and Mrs. Force both fell upon their
daughter with rebuke and admonition, but were soothed
and mollified when Wynnette assured them not only that
she had taken no harm on this occasion, but that she
never meant to repeat the last night’s performance again
so long as she should live.</p>

<p class='c008'>When breakfast was over the family party adjourned
to a pleasant morning room looking out upon the sea,
and occupied themselves with opening and reading their
letters, which had come in by the morning’s mail.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force had letters from his farm manager and
from his attorney, giving satisfactory accounts of affairs
at Mondreer.</p>

<p class='c008'>Leonidas had equally good news from Beeves concerning
his little estate of Greenbushes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Force received a short note, ill-spelled and worse
written, from her housekeeper, but it gave good account
of domestic affairs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rosemary Hedge had a joint letter from her mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>and aunt, saying that they were both in good health,
and giving their child plenty of good counsel.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette received an old-fashioned letter from young
Grandiere, which she laughed over and refused to show
to any one.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the midst of this occupation they were interrupted
by the opening of the door, and the entrance of a footman,
who touched his forehead with a grave air and
stood in silence.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is it?” inquired the earl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you please, my lord, it is Old Silly,” solemnly
replied the man.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Old Zillah?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What of her?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you please, my lord, she is dead.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dead!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Old Zillah! Why—when did she die?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you please, my lord, we don’t know. Kato, the
under scullery maid, who carried her some breakfast
this morning, found her dead on her bed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was to have been expected. She was nearly a century
old. It is well!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XLVIII<br /> <span class='large'>OLD ZILLAH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“She has come to life,” said Wynnette, quoting the
words of the departed woman.</p>

<p class='c008'>All looked at the girl in some surprise. With all her
oddities, Wynnette was not used to make such speeches
as that. And now, for the first time, they noticed that
Wynnette’s face was very pale, with dark circles under
her eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>“What is the matter with you, my dear?” inquired
her mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing at all, mamma,” answered the girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She sat by the open window late last night and fell
asleep there, and slept until I woke her up this morning.
That was quite enough to make her ill,” Odalite explained.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nay, my dear; in such fine June weather as the
present, and in such pure air as ours, it would hardly
have hurt her had she slept outdoors,” said the earl.
“But what do you mean, my dear, by saying that our
poor Old Zillah ‘has come to life’?” he inquired, as he
turned to the girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing heterodox, uncle. Nothing but what we
hear from our pulpits on every Easter Sunday morning,”
she replied.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Only in this case the truth seems to be very marked.
A woman nearly a hundred years old must have been
nearly dead for many years and now has certainly come
to life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing new, uncle, please. I never said anything
new in my life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you put old truths in a very new way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Eternal truth, uncle, eternal truth; plain to gentle
and simple, to young and old; plain as the sunshine to
all who can see; hidden only from them who are blind,
or who choose to keep their eyes shut.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hum! Truth that neither the aged, the invalid nor
the bereaved can afford to disregard, at least. And
now, my dear, I must leave you, to inquire into the
cause of Old Zillah’s sudden death. Will you come
with me, gentlemen?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Force and Leonidas arose to attend him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Le gave the invalid the support of his strong young
arm.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>And so the three men passed out of the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mamma, did you know anything about this wonderful
old woman?” inquired Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very little, my dear. Only the years of my earliest
childhood were passed here. Old Zillah was an object
of terror to me. Partly, perhaps, because she wore a
man’s coat over her skirt, and a man’s hat on her head,
and partly because she had the reputation of being a
wise woman or a witch. She never came to the castle,
and I never saw her except by chance, when I went with
my nursery governess to walk or ride. She never came
near me or spoke to me. I think I should have gone
into fits if she had.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How old were you then, mamma?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do not know when I first began to hear of Old Zillah,
or when I first saw her. She was the shadow and
the terror of my dawn of life. I was but four years old
when I lost my mother, and then my father left this
place, taking me with him; and he went to his estate in
Ireland—Weirdwaste, on the west coast.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Weirdwaste!’ What a name! Did you live long
at Weirdwaste, mamma, dear?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, many years alone there with my governess. My
father was traveling on the continent.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What sort of a place was it, mamma?” inquired
Wynnette. And Rosemary and Elva drew their chairs
nearer to the sofa on which their mother sat to hear
her answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was an old manor house on the inland end of a
long, flat, dreary point of land stretching into the Atlantic
Ocean. At high tide the entire cape, to within
a few rods of the manor wall, was covered by the sea,
and day and night the swash of the sea was heard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How lonely you must have been, mamma, with no
one but your governess and the servants,” said Elva.
“But perhaps you had neighbors,” she added.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No; no neighbors at all. There was no one within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>miles of us but the poorest Irish peasants, who were
tenants of my father. The estate was vast in extent of
territory, but poor in soil. The land steward lived in
the manor house, to take care of it and of me. They
kept two old servants—a man and a woman—an old
horse, and older jaunting car. That is how I lived at
Weirdwaste.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! what a lonely life! How long did you live
there, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Until I was nearly fifteen years of age, when my
health failed, and the surgeon from the nearest town
was called to see me, and thought my case so serious that
he wrote to my father, who was in Paris. My father
then came to see me, took me and my governess to
Brighton, and established us in elegant lodgings on the
King’s Road.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That must have been a most delightful change. How
long did you stay in Brighton, mamma? And where
did you go next? Not back to Weirdwaste, I hope,”
said Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, not back to Weirdwaste. I have never seen the
dreary place since I left it,” replied the lady, in a low
voice, but with paling cheeks and troubled brow.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mamma, love,” said Odalite, rising, “will you come
with me into the library now and help me to translate
the passage in Camoëns we were talking about yesterday?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, dear,” replied the lady, rising to follow her eldest
daughter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, I’m blest if that isn’t playing it rather too low
down on a fellow, Odalite—I mean it is very inconsiderate
in you to carry off mamma just as she is telling
about the days of her youth, for the very first time, too!
Bah! bother! what a nuisance!”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Mrs. Force and her eldest daughter had passed
out of the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>The death of Old Zillah caused quite a commotion in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>the castle and its neighborhood. Notwithstanding her
age, or, perhaps, because of her great age, her death
came as a surprise, not to say as a shock, to the community.
She had lived so long that it almost seemed
as if she must always continue to live.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, it’s like as if the old tower of the ruined castle
itself had fallen!” said one to another.</p>

<p class='c008'>People came from far and near to see the remains of
the centenarian, and to get her real age, and hear some
facts of her life. And all the cruel old legends were
raked up again, until the whole air of the place was full
of fetor, fire and brimstone. The people reveled in the
moral malaria.</p>

<p class='c008'>The mortal body of the oldest retainer of the House
of Enderby at length found a peaceful resting place in
Enderby churchyard.</p>

<p class='c008'>No peeress of the realm ever had a larger funeral than
this pauper, at least so far as the number of followers
went.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not until night on the day after the funeral
that Wynnette slipped away from the family circle and
went to the housekeeper’s room to hear the promised
story.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will hear both sides,” she said to herself, “though
I do believe Old Zillah’s version to be the true one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She found the good woman seated at a small worktable
and engaged in knitting.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Mrs. Kelsy, how are you to-night?” inquired
Wynnette, as she took the offered seat beside the dame.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thanky’, miss, I’m none the better for the worriment
of this week,” replied the housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You mean the funeral?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The whole on’t, miss! The greatest crowd as ever
was every day this week, not even honoring the Sabbath
itself, but coming more on that day than any other!
And the talk, and the gossip, and the raking up of old
scandals, until I was soul sick of it all. And all because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>a wise woman, over a hundred years old, was found dead
in her bed. Warraloo! How else and where else should
she ha’ been found dead, I’d like to know!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you have had a night and day of rest, and I
hope you feel recovered.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Rest, is it, miss? Recovered, is it? Not very much
of either! It is dead beat I am!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am sorry to hear that. I was hoping that you
would feel well to-night and be inclined to tell me the
story of the pretty maiden you promised.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, ay, well, there is not so much to tell. And now
the old creature as hung on so long is gone, I don’t mind
telling it so much. The girl’s soul may have rest now
that her mither doesn’t harry it up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I hope it will,” said Wynnette, in a conciliating
tone. “You will tell me the story now?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes! and whatever other story you may hear about
it will be false, for I know that you will hear other
stories, if you haven’t heard ’em already. There’s
plenty of ’em going around, I tell you, and no two alike.
But only I have the truth, for I have it straight from
my mother, who had it from her’n! So it must be true!
And no other story could be!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I suppose if Old Zillah were alive she also could
give the real facts,” ventured Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She? Least of all in this world could she tell it!
For not only did she fail to tell the truth, but she told
a many mad fancies; for she was about as mad as a
March hare! Saw visions and talked with departed
spirits, prophesied future events, and all that, she did!
Yes, miss. She has been that a way ever since I knowed
her, and as I have heard tell, was that a way ever since
she lost her daughter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell me about her daughter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m a-gwine to. Well, you see, it seems the feyther
had been undergardener, and he died, and then the
widow was given the use of a little hut in the outside of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>the old castle wall, on the lane. And there she lived
and brought up her only child, Phebe. They were both
employed in the poultry yard.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phebe grew up beautiful as an angel—so beautiful
that everybody who happened to meet her stopped to
look at her—so beautiful, that her beauty turned her
own head, as well as her mother’s. While she was yet
a child all the gentry that met her gave her half crowns,
and even half guineas, for the love of her fair face. At
least so ’twas said, and so ’twas handed down. And
people used to make such foolish speeches about her as
that she was lovely enough to turn the head of a king.</p>

<p class='c008'>“These speeches did turn her mother’s head, and her
own as well. All the young men were in love with her,
but she scorned them all for a poor little imp of a stableboy,
an orphan as had been her playmate all her life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did hear that it was for the sake of the young earl
she flouted the others,” said Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes, I dare say—that was one of the stories that
went round! That was false. The young earl did come
down to celebrate his coming of age, and his mother and
sisters came with him, and made up their minds to stay
with him, which they might do until he should marry,
in which case they would have to go to Kedge Hall, an
old manor house on the moors. So my lady seemed to
think the longer she could keep my lord, her son, from
getting a wife, the better it would be for her and her
girls.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Among the men staying at the castle was an artist.
He was to paint a picture of St. Cecelia for the countess,
but he wanted a model. One day my lady, out driving,
happened to see Phebe, and had her up to the castle to
sit to the artist. And then the mischief began. My lord
fell in love with her. Fairly went out of his senses for
love of this beautiful creature, who didn’t even know
how to read.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And my lady encouraged the folly and wickedness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>Eh, my dear, gentlefolks were not particular in those
days. ‘Here,’ she said, ‘was a beauty right on his own
land, the child of his tenant, one of his own born slaves,
bound to do his will, who might amuse his fancy and
keep him from marriage for many a year.’ She never
feared such a thing as my lord marrying the girl. Such
folly was not to be thought, and never was thought of
by either of them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But,” said Wynnette, “I heard that the earl had
married her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Stuff and nonsense! He never dreamed of such a
thing! He was the proudest man alive! And he was
engaged to a duke’s daughter! But the crazy old mother
and the silly young girl fancied that he even might do
that for love of Phebe’s fair face. So the poor stableboy
was thrown over, and the young earl was received.
The boy got madly jealous, and so—months after,
when the hapless girl was found dead at the bottom of
the shaft in the old castle—the stableboy was arrested
on suspicion of the murder.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know,” said Wynnette, “and the guide to Enderby
Castle says that he was tried and convicted and hanged
at Carlisle. But I have heard that contradicted.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, it is contradicted. I do not know the truth.
It has been so long ago that no living person can remember
it, now that Old Zillah is gone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She could,” said Wynnette.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes! she could! But she got facts and fancies
so mixed up in her poor old brain that no one would
dream of trusting to her stories. If you could ever have
had the chance to see her, miss, you would have seen
how very mad she was.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette did not think it necessary to explain that
she had seen Old Zillah and heard her story.</p>

<p class='c008'>To no one could the girl breathe one word of her terrible
night in the old castle. Sometimes she was half
inclined to believe that she had really fallen asleep on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>the window sill and dreamed it all—from the moment
of horror and amazement when the spectral eyes lighted
up the loopholes of the old wall, to the moment when
she was awakened by the voice of her sister.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wynnette was more bewildered than she liked to own
herself to be—bewildered as to the dream, or the reality
of her terrible night! Bewildered as to the relative
truth or falsehood of the two conflicting stories she had
heard of the beautiful peasant girl’s fate.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is dream and what is reality? What is fact
and what is fable?” she asked herself continually.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XLIX<br /> <span class='large'>BROTHER AND SISTER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile there was another member of the family
circle fully as much perplexed as was Wynnette, though
upon another subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl of Enderby could not reconcile all his
knowledge—his lifelong knowledge of Angus Anglesea,
his schoolmate at Harrow; his classmate at Oxford, his
brother-in-arms in India, the brave, tender, faithful
friend and comrade of many years and many lands—with
this thief, forger, bigamist, described under his
name by Elfrida Force and all her family.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Elf,” he said to her one day, as the two sat <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i>
in the library—all the other members of the family
circle having gone out for a stroll on the top of the
cliffs—“Elf, my dear, I have had some trials in my
time—not the least among them, my inherited malady,
dooming me to an early death and barring me from
marriage——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Francis, don’t say that! Medical science has
reached such perfection, you may be restored to health;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>and you are yet not middle-aged—you may marry and
be happy,” said the lady, almost in tears.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, Elf! No, dear! It is impossible! But it is
not of my infirmities I wish to speak now. I would
rather never mention them—much rather forget them,
if that were possible! I only meant to say that of all
the trials I have ever suffered, that of hearing such
news of Anglesea as you have told me is the most painful!
I cannot forget it! I think of it constantly, by
day and by night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am very sorry that we had to tell you, Francis.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Elf! You knew Anglesea in those early days when
we both came down to spend our holidays at Brighton
with you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes; I remember.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You knew him then. Could you have believed such
villainies of him?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, not then.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nor could I then, nor can I now. I wish the man
were in England. I would go to him and make these
charges face to face, and put him on his defense. I shall
never rest until I put him on his defense.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you not believe what we have told you and proved
to you—that this man is a thief, a forger and a bigamist,
even on his own showing?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I believe that you believe it, my dear. And I believe
as much of it as I can believe in the absence of the accused.
And when a man is accused of crime he should
be present and be put upon his defense. I wish to charge
Anglesea to his face with these felonies and to hear what
he has to say.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Elfrida Force looked so coldly on her brother in answer
to these words that he hastened to say:</p>

<p class='c008'>“See here, my dear. Consider how I loved and
trusted that man from my youth up. He was older than
myself. He was my mentor, my guide, philosopher and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>friend. I could no more have doubted his honor than I
could have doubted yours.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The lady winced.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Think of it, my dear. Do you wonder that I am
sorely perplexed at what I hear of him? Or that I wish
to hear what he has to say for himself? Suppose any
one—Anglesea, for instance, before I had heard a word
against him, when I loved and trusted him most—had
come to me and said: ‘Your sister, whom you love and
honor so much, has forfeited both love and honor——’
Elfrida! Heavens! What is the matter?” suddenly exclaimed
the earl, as the lady sank back pallid and fainting
in her chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is——Go on,” said the sister, recovering herself
with an effort. “Nothing is the matter. You were saying
that if Anglesea had come to you with slanders of
your sister——What would you have done?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should have knocked him down and kicked him out,
first of all, as a preliminary to challenging him. Be
sure I should not have believed his story told behind
your back. And I am certain you would not wish me to
be less just to Anglesea than to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well. I do not believe he will ever dare to show
his face in England again; but if he should, and you
should meet him, make the charge that we have made
and see how he will meet it. Of course he will deny all
and accuse his accusers of conspiracy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is all very painful and very perplexing, but do not
think otherwise than that I will stand by you and yours,
Elfrida, under all circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am quite sure that you will, dear Francis,” replied
the lady; and their talk drifted to other topics.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I shall miss you very much, sister, when you go
abroad,” he said at length.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I shall not go, Francis. I shall remain with
you. I have been over the continent so often that I do
not care to see it again,” replied the lady.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>“What do you say, Elfrida? You will not go on this
tour with your husband and children? You will stay
here with your invalid brother? That is good news to
me, but what will your husband say to such a plan?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I had a talk with Mr. Force before making
up my mind. We talked it over last night. He
thinks just as I do—that it is best for me to stay with
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“He is very kind; very, very kind. But you will both
give up much for the sake of a poor, sick man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, indeed. I really do not care for the continental
tour, I have made it so often.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But there are so many changes since you made it
last.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, there is gas instead of lamplight in all the
cities; railway trains instead of diligences on all the
highways; and sons on the thrones of their fathers. I
am content to know of these things. I do not care to
see them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Mr. Force? He will miss you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dear brother, our honeymoon was passed twenty-two
years ago. Young love has matured to old love, or
rather to love that never can know age nor absence. It
is not necessary that we should always be looking into
each other’s eyes to make sure that we are happy in our
union.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yet I dare say you never tried it. I dare swear you
were never apart from each other for twenty-four hours
in your married life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No; we never were.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is why you talk so glibly of a separation for
months. You had better not try it, Elfrida. You had
better go with your husband and party, or make them
stay here with you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not so, Francis. I will not leave you, now that I
have come to you after so many years of separation.
And, on the other hand, I will not keep the other members
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>of our family party from their travel. It is necessary
that young people should have the advantage of
this continental tour, and it is desirable that they should
have the protection of their father, as well as of their
cousin. So I must stay here, and they must go. If Mr.
Force or myself should grow lonesome during the season
of separation he can come here to me. Neither Abel
nor myself should feel the slightest hesitation in leaving
our young girls in the care of their cousin, Leonidas.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear, you have some strange, new, and, I suppose,
American ideas of the liberty allowable to young
people.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“To our own young people, who certainly may be
trusted with liberty,” replied Elfrida Force, with a
smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, of course—of course. I am human and selfish
enough to be very glad that you are to stay with me instead
of going with your party.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The brother and sister then talked of some details relating
to the intended tour, until the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i> was
broken into by the return of the walking party.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the first of July that the tourists, consisting of
Abel, Leonidas, Odalite, Wynnette and Elva Force and
Rosemary Hedge, set out from Enderby to London, en
route for Dover and Paris.</p>

<p class='c008'>They were to have a three months’ travel over the continent,
and were to return on the first of October, unless
they should receive advices from the earl to meet him
and his sister at Baden-Baden, where he often went in
the autumn for the benefit of his health.</p>

<p class='c008'>And with this understanding, and with the promise
of an incessant fire of letters from both sides, the friends
parted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Leonidas, it should have been explained, on account
of his six years active service at sea—serving double
turns, as he put it—had got a six months furlough, beginning
from the first of May. He would, therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>not be due at the navy department to report for orders
until the first of November.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the large party had left the castle, life at Enderby
settled down to the calmest, not to say the dullest,
routine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Elfrida Force spent her time in waiting on her invalid
brother, reading the old black-letter tomes in the library,
and in writing letters to her absent family and reading
their letters to herself. Sometimes she walked or rode
abroad, but always in company with her brother.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes the Vicar of Enderby came and dined with
them, and played a game of chess in the evening with
the earl. Two or three times a week the village doctor
looked in to see his chronic patient, and once, on his advice,
a telegram to London brought down a titled court
physician to see the invalid.</p>

<p class='c008'>Beyond these no company came to Enderby, and no
visits were made by the earl or his sister.</p>

<p class='c008'>The castle was too remote and too difficult of approach
for mere visits of ceremony; and the sick earl was too
much of a recluse to encourage or enjoy the visits of his
neighbors. So the lives of the brother and sister, in the
absence of their relatives, passed in almost monastic
seclusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>And so July, August and half of September passed.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was on the sixteenth of the last-mentioned month
that the village practitioner, after a long visit and talk
with his patient, sent a telegram to the London physician,
who came to Enderby by the night’s express.</p>

<p class='c008'>The result of the consultation by the sofa of the invalid
patient was this—that the earl must depart for
Baden-Baden as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>Preparations were immediately made for departure.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among other precautions, Elfrida Force did not forget
Wynnette’s dear dog. She made a visit to the kennels,
where Joshua had found friends among his canine
as well as his human companions, and there she spoke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>with the grooms and gave them some money in advance
and promised them more on her return if she should find
Joshua well and hearty.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think if anything were to happen to the dog my
daughter Wynnette would almost break her heart,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bless ’ee, my lady, nothing shall happen the brute
but good treatment. He’s a dog as any one might grow
fond on; and as for we, why, we fairly dotes on him,
my lady. And so do him on we. Look, my lady! Hi!
Joshway!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The dog came bounding from some distant spot and
jumped upon the groom with every demonstration of joy
until he saw his mistress, when the old love and loyalty
immediately asserted itself, and he sprang from the
groom to the lady.</p>

<p class='c008'>Elfrida Force caressed him to his heart’s content, and
then to divert his attention she emptied a small basket of
cold meat that she had brought for the purpose, and
while he was busy with a well-covered beef bone she
patted his head and slipped away.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the morning of the same day the earl sent off a
telegram to Mr. Force, at the Hotel d’Angleterre, St.
Petersburg, merely saying: “We leave to-morrow for
Baden-Baden. Write to us at the Hotel d’Amerique.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Late in the evening he received the following answer:</p>

<p class='c008'>“We shall join you at the Hotel d’Amerique.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The earl handed the telegram to his sister, saying:</p>

<p class='c008'>“I told you the bridegroom would be impatient. The
bridal honeymoon was sweet, no doubt. But what was
that to be compared to the honeymoon of the silver wedding,
eh, Elf?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She was about to retort by asking him what he could
know about it; but remembering in time the pathos of
her brother’s life, and not quite knowing what else to
say, she remarked that the twenty-fifth anniversary of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>her wedding was yet three years off. And then she
kissed her brother and bade him good-night.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fraught with destiny, the Civil War brought great
changes and brought with misery final happiness to the
Forces, as will be related in the third and final volume
of this series, under the title of “When Shadows Die.”
This is published in uniform style and price with this
volume.</p>

<p class='c011'>A book that appeals to Americans as a vivid picture of Revolutionary
scenes. The story is a strong one, a thrilling one. It causes the true
American to flush with excitement, to devour chapter after chapter, until
the eyes smart, and it fairly smokes with patriotism. The love story is a
singularly charming idyl.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong>IN DEFIANCE OF THE KING.</strong> A Romance of the American Revolution.
By Chauncey C. Hotchkiss. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Hotchkiss has etched in burning words a story of Yankee bravery,
and true love that thrills from beginning to end, with the spirit of the
Revolution. The heart beats quickly, and we feel ourselves taking a
part in the exciting scenes described. His whole story is so absorbing
that you will sit up far into the night to finish it. As a love romance
it is charming.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong>GARTHOWEN.</strong> A story of a Welsh Homestead. By Allen Raine. Cloth,
12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is a little idyl of humble life and enduring love, laid bare before
us, very real and pure, which in its telling shows us some strong points of
Welsh character—the pride, the hasty temper, the quick dying out of wrath....
We call this a well-written story, interesting alike through its
romance and its glimpses into another life than ours. A delightful and
clever picture of Welsh village life. The result is excellent.”—Detroit Free
Press.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong>MIFANWY.</strong> The story of a Welsh Singer. By Allan Raine. Cloth,
12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is a love story, simple, tender and pretty as one would care to
read. The action throughout is brisk and pleasing; the characters, it is apparent
at once, are as true to life as though the author had known them
all personally. Simple in all its situations, the story is worked up in that
touching and quaint strain which never grows wearisome, no matter how
often the lights and shadows of love are introduced. It rings true, and
does not tax the imagination.”—Boston Herald.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong>DARNLEY.</strong> A Romance of the times of Henry VIII. and Cardinal Wolsey.
By G. P. R. James. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davies.
Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c011'>In point of publication, “Darnley” is that work by Mr. James which
follows “Richelieu,” and, if rumor can be credited, it was owing to the advice
and insistence of our own Washington Irving that we are indebted
primarily for the story, the young author questioning whether he could
properly paint the difference in the characters of the two great cardinals.
And it is not surprising that James should have hesitated; he had been
eminently successful in giving to the world the portrait of Richelieu as a
man, and by attempting a similar task with Wolsey as the theme, was
much like tempting fortune. Irving insisted that “Darnley” came naturally
in sequence, and this opinion being supported by Sir Walter Scott,
the author set about the work.</p>

<p class='c011'>As a historical romance “Darnley” is a book that can be taken up
pleasurably again and again, for there is about it that subtle charm which
those who are strangers to the works of G. P. R. James have claimed was
only to be imparted by Dumas.</p>

<p class='c011'>If there was nothing more about the work to attract especial attention,
the account of the meeting of the kings on the historic “field of the cloth of
gold” would entitle the story to the most favorable consideration of every
reader.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is really but little pure romance in this story, for the author has
taken care to imagine love passages only between those whom history has
credited with having entertained the tender passion one for another, and
he succeeds in making such lovers as all the world must love.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong>CAPTAIN BRAND, OF THE SCHOONER CENTIPEDE.</strong> By Lieut.
Henry A. Wise, U.&#160;S.&#160;N. (Harry Gringo). Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations
by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c011'>The re-publication of this story will please those lovers of sea yarns
who delight in so much of the salty flavor of the ocean as can come through
the medium of a printed page, for never has a story of the sea and those
“who go down in ships” been written by one more familiar with the scenes
depicted.</p>

<p class='c011'>The one book of this gifted author which is best remembered, and which
will be read with pleasure for many years to come, is “Captain Brand,”
who, as the author states on his title page, was a “pirate of eminence in
the West Indies.” As a sea story pure and simple, “Captain Brand” has
never been excelled, and as a story of piratical life, told without the usual
embellishments of blood and thunder, it has no equal.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong>NICK OF THE WOODS.</strong> A story of the Early Settlers of Kentucky. By
Robert Montgomery Bird. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c011'>This most popular novel and thrilling story of early frontier life in
Kentucky was originally published in the year 1837. The novel, long out of
print, had in its day a phenomenal sale, for its realistic presentation of
Indian and frontier life in the early days of settlement in the South, narrated
in the tale with all the art of a practiced writer. A very charming
love romance runs through the story. This new and tasteful edition of
“Nick of the Woods” will be certain to make many new admirers for
this enchanting story from Dr. Bird’s clever and versatile pen.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong>GUY FAWKES.</strong> A Romance of the Gunpowder Treason. By Wm. Harrison
Ainsworth. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by George Cruikshank.
Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c011'>The “Gunpowder Plot” was a modest attempt to blow up Parliament,
the King and his Counsellors. James of Scotland, then King of England,
was weak-minded and extravagant. He hit upon the efficient scheme of
extorting money from the people by imposing taxes on the Catholics. In
their natural resentment to this extortion, a handful of bold spirits concluded
to overthrow the government. Finally the plotters were arrested,
and the King put to torture Guy Fawkes and the other prisoners with
royal vigor. A very intense love story runs through the entire romance.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong>THE SPIRIT OF THE BORDER.</strong> A Romance of the Early Settlers in the
Ohio Valley. By Zane Grey. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c011'>A book rather out of the ordinary is this “Spirit of the Border.” The
main thread of the story has to do with the work of the Moravian missionaries
in the Ohio Valley. Incidentally the reader is given details of the
frontier life of those hardy pioneers who broke the wilderness for the planting
of this great nation. Chief among these, as a matter of course, is
Lewis Wetzel, one of the most peculiar, and at the same time the most
admirable of all the brave men who spent their lives battling with the
savage foe, that others might dwell in comparative security.</p>

<p class='c011'>Details of the establishment and destruction of the Moravian “Village
of Peace” are given at some length, and with minute description. The
efforts to Christianize the Indians are described as they never have been
before, and the author has depicted the characters of the leaders of the
several Indian tribes with great care, which of itself will be of interest to
the student.</p>

<p class='c011'>By no means least among the charms of the story are the vivid word-pictures
of the thrilling adventures, and the intense paintings of the beauties
of nature, as seen in the almost unbroken forests.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is the spirit of the frontier which is described, and one can by it,
perhaps, the better understand why men, and women, too, willingly braved
every privation and danger that the westward progress of the star of empire
might be the more certain and rapid. A love story, simple and tender,
runs through the book.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong>RICHELIEU.</strong> A tale of France in the reign of King Louis XIII. By G.&#160;P.&#160;R. James. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1829 Mr. James published his first romance, “Richelieu,” and was
recognized at once as one of the masters of the craft.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this book he laid the story during those later days of the great cardinal’s
life, when his power was beginning to wane, but while it was
yet sufficiently strong to permit now and then of volcanic outbursts which
overwhelmed foes and carried friends to the topmost wave of prosperity.
One of the most striking portions of the story is that of Cinq Mar’s conspiracy;
the method of conducting criminal cases, and the political trickery
resorted to by royal favorites; affording a better insight into the statecraft
of that day than can be had even by an exhaustive study of history.
It is a powerful romance of love and diplomacy, and in point of thrilling
and absorbing interest has never been excelled.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong>ROB OF THE BOWL.</strong> A Story of the Early Days of
Maryland. By John P. Kennedy. Cloth, 12mo. Four page
illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c011'>This story is an authentic exposition of the manners and customs during
Lord Baltimore’s rule. The greater portion of the action takes place
in St. Mary’s—the original capital of the State.</p>

<p class='c011'>The quaint character of Rob, the loss of whose legs was supplied by a
wooden bowl strapped to his thighs, his misfortunes and mother wit, far
outshine those fair to look upon. Pirates and smugglers did Rob consort
with for gain, and it was to him that Blanche Werden owed her life and
her happiness, as the author has told us in such an enchanting manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>As a series of pictures of early colonial life in Maryland, “Rob of the
Bowl” has no equal. The story is full of splendid action, with a charming
love story, and a plot that never loosens the grip of its interest to its last
page.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong>TICONDEROGA.</strong> A Story of Early Frontier Life in the
Mohawk Valley. By G. P. R. James. Cloth, 12mo. Four
page illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c011'>The setting of the story is decidedly more picturesque than any ever
evolved by Cooper. The story is located on the frontier of New York
State. The principal characters in the story include an English gentleman,
his beautiful daughter, Lord Howe, and certain Indian sachems belonging
to the Five Nations, and the story ends with the Battle of Ticonderoga.</p>

<p class='c011'>The character of Captain Brooks, who voluntarily decides to sacrifice
his own life in order to save the son of the Englishman, is not among the
least of the attractions of this story, which holds the attention of the reader
even to the last page.</p>

<p class='c011'>Interwoven with the plot is the Indian “blood” law, which demands a
life for a life, whether it be that of the murderer or one of his race. A
more charming story of mingled love and adventure has never been written
than “Ticonderoga.”</p>

<p class='c008'><strong>MARY DERWENT.</strong> A tale of the Wyoming Valley in
1778. By Mrs. Ann S. Stephens. Cloth, 12mo. Four illustrations
by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c011'>The scene of this fascinating story of early frontier life is laid in the
Valley of Wyoming. Aside from Mary Derwent, who is of course the
heroine, the story deals with Queen Esther’s son, Giengwatah, the Butlers
of notorious memory, and the adventures of the Colonists with the Indians.</p>

<p class='c011'>Though much is made of the Massacre of Wyoming, a great portion
of the tale describes the love making between Mary Derwent’s sister, Walter
Butler, and one of the defenders of Forty Fort.</p>

<p class='c011'>This historical novel stands out bright and pleasing, because of the
mystery and notoriety of several of the actors, the tender love scenes,
descriptions of the different localities, and the struggles of the settlers.
It holds the attention of the reader even to the last page.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong>WINDSOR CASTLE.</strong> A Historical Romance of the Reign of Henry VIII.,
Catharine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn. By Wm. Harrison Ainsworth. Cloth,
12mo. with four illustrations by George Cruikshank. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Windsor Castle” is the story of Henry VIII., Catharine, and Anne
Boleyn. “Bluff King Hal,” although a well-loved monarch, was none too
good a one in many ways. Of all his selfishness and unwarrantable acts,
none was more discreditable than his divorce from Catharine, and his marriage
to the beautiful Anne Boleyn. The King’s love was as brief as it
was vehement. Jane Seymour, waiting maid on the Queen, attracted him,
and Anne Boleyn was forced to the block to make room for her successor.
This romance is one of extreme interest to all readers.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong>HORSESHOE ROBINSON.</strong> A tale of the Tory Ascendency in South Carolina
in 1780. By John P. Kennedy. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J.
Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c011'>Among the old favorites in the field of what is known as historical fiction,
there are none which appeal to a larger number of Americans than
Horseshoe Robinson, and this because it is the only story which depicts
with fidelity to the facts the heroic efforts of the colonists in South Carolina
to defend their homes against the brutal oppression of the British
under such leaders as Cornwallis and Tarleton.</p>

<p class='c011'>The reader is charmed with the story of love which forms the thread
of the tale, and then impressed with the wealth of detail concerning those
times. The picture of the manifold sufferings of the people, is never overdrawn,
but painted faithfully and honestly by one who spared neither
time nor labor in his efforts to present in this charming love story all that
price in blood and tears which the Carolinians paid as their share in the
winning of the republic.</p>

<p class='c011'>Take it all in all, “Horseshoe Robinson” is a work which should be
found on every book-shelf, not only because it is a most entertaining
story, but because of the wealth of valuable information concerning the
colonists which it contains. That it has been brought out once more, well
illustrated, is something which will give pleasure to thousands who have
long desired an opportunity to read the story again, and to the many who
have tried vainly in these latter days to procure a copy that they might
read it for the first time.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong>THE PEARL OF ORR’S ISLAND.</strong> A story of the Coast of Maine. By
Harriet Beecher Stowe. Cloth, 12mo. Illustrated. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c011'>Written prior to 1862, the “Pearl of Orr’s Island” is ever new; a book
filled with delicate fancies, such as seemingly array themselves anew each
time one reads them. One sees the “sea like an unbroken mirror all
around the pine-girt, lonely shores of Orr’s Island,” and straightway
comes “the heavy, hollow moan of the surf on the beach, like the wild
angry howl of some savage animal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Who can read of the beginning of that sweet life, named Mara, which
came into this world under the very shadow of the Death angel’s wings,
without having an intense desire to know how the premature bud blossomed?
Again and again one lingers over the descriptions of the character
of that baby boy Moses, who came through the tempest, amid the
angry billows, pillowed on his dead mother’s breast.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is no more faithful portrayal of New England life than that
which Mrs. Stowe gives in “The Pearl of Orr’s Island.”</p>

<p class='c008'><strong>THE LAST TRAIL.</strong> A story of early days in the Ohio
Valley. By Zane Grey. Cloth, 12mo. Four page illustrations
by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Last Trail” is a story of the border. The scene is laid at Fort
Henry, where Col. Ebenezer Zane with his family have built up a village
despite the attacks of savages and renegades. The Colonel’s brother and
Wetzel, known as Deathwind by the Indians, are the bordermen who devote
their lives to the welfare of the white people. A splendid love story runs
through the book.</p>

<p class='c011'>That Helen Sheppard, the heroine, should fall in love with such a
brave, skilful scout as Jonathan Zane seems only reasonable after his years
of association and defense of the people of the settlement from savages and
renegades.</p>

<p class='c011'>If one has a liking for stories of the trail, where the white man matches
brains against savage cunning, for tales of ambush and constant striving for
the mastery, “The Last Trail” will be greatly to his liking.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong>THE KNIGHTS OF THE HORSESHOE.</strong> A traditionary
tale of the Cocked Hat Gentry in the Old Dominion. By
Dr. Wm. A. Caruthers. Cloth, 12mo. Four page illustrations
by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many will hail with delight the re-publication of this rare and justly
famous story of early American colonial life and old-time Virginian
hospitality.</p>

<p class='c011'>Much that is charmingly interesting will be found in this tale that so
faithfully depicts early American colonial life, and also here is found all
the details of the founding of the Tramontane Order, around which has
ever been such a delicious flavor of romance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Early customs, much love making, plantation life, politics, intrigues, and
finally that wonderful march across the mountains which resulted in the
discovery and conquest of the fair Valley of Virginia. A rare book filled
with a delicious flavor of romance.</p>

<p class='c008'><strong>BY BERWEN BANKS.</strong> A Romance of Welsh Life. By
Allen Raine. Cloth, 12mo. Four page illustrations by J.
Watson Davis. Price $1.00.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is a tender and beautiful romance of the idyllic. A charming picture
of life in a Welsh seaside village. It is something of a prose-poem, true,
tender and graceful.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
